How does U.S. Customs and Border Protection address the importation of goods produced by forced or child labor?,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) addresses the importation of goods produced by forced or child labor primarily through the issuance of Withhold Release Orders (WROs). These orders are directed against imported merchandise that is suspected of being produced using forced or child labor. The WROs effectively prevent the entry of such goods into the United States, thereby enforcing compliance with international labor standards and U.S. laws.

The U.S. Department of Labor supports this effort by maintaining a list of goods and their source countries, which are believed to be produced by forced or child labor. This list serves as a reference for CBP and other agencies to identify and take action against such goods.

The regulatory framework for addressing forced or child labor in imports is part of a broader strategy to combat human trafficking and related crimes. This includes various offenses under U.S. law, such as those listed in Title 18 of the U.S. Code, and the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. These laws provide the legal basis for actions against human trafficking and the importation of goods produced under exploitative conditions.

Additionally, financial institutions play a role in identifying and reporting suspicious activities related to human trafficking, which can include the importation of goods produced by forced or child labor. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provides guidance on identifying financial and behavioral indicators of human trafficking, which can be used to detect and report such activities.

Overall, the approach to addressing the importation of goods produced by forced or child labor involves a combination of regulatory enforcement, inter-agency collaboration, and financial monitoring to prevent and penalize the exploitation of labor in international trade.","['imported into the United States.

Human \ntraffickers can exploit individuals within the border of a country, and even in a victim’s own \nhome.  Human trafficking can also begin as human smuggling, as individuals who enter a \ncountry voluntarily and illegally are inherently vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and often \nowe a large debt to their smuggler.10\nBecause the information financial institutions collect and report is vital to identifying human \ntrafficking and stopping the growth of this crime, it is imperative that financial institutions \nenable their detection and reporting of suspicious transactions by becoming aware of the current \nmethodologies that traffickers and facilitators use.  It is also critical that customer-facing staff are \naware of behavioral indicators that may indicate human trafficking, as the only outside contact for \nvictims of human trafficking may occur when visiting financial institutions.\n10.\t See U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, “Human Trafficking vs Human Smuggling,” (Summer 2017); and \nsee also U.S. Department of State, “Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling: Understanding the Difference,” (June \n27, 2017).\n11.\t An establishment that provides food, drinks, dancing, and music, and is typically found in Latin American \ncommunities.   \n12.\t See Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 54 (July 2018).

New Typologies of Human Trafficking \nTo evade detection, hide their illicit proceeds, and profit off the backs of victims, human traffickers \nemploy a variety of evolving techniques.  Below are four typologies, identified in Bank Secrecy Act \n(BSA) data since FinCEN issued the 2014 Advisory, that human traffickers and facilitators have \nused to launder money.  \n1.  Front Companies \nHuman traffickers routinely establish and use front companies, sometimes legal entities, to hide \nthe true nature of a business, and its illicit activities, owners, and associates.  Front companies are \nbusinesses that combine illicit proceeds with those gained from legitimate business operations.  \nExamples of front companies used by human traffickers for labor or sex trafficking include massage \nbusinesses, escort services, bars, restaurants, and cantinas.11  In the case of businesses that act as \na front for human trafficking, typically the establishment appears legitimate with registrations \nand licenses.  The front company generates revenue from sales of alcoholic beverages and cover \ncharges.  Patrons, however, also can obtain illicit sexual services from trafficked individuals, \nusually elsewhere in the establishment.12  In addition, illicit massage businesses or nail and hair \nsalons can offer sexual services under the guise of legitimate businesses and/or exploit individuals \nfor the purpose of forced labor.13  Often, these establishments will appear to be a single storefront, \nyet are part of a larger network.  Payments for these illicit services are usually in cash, and \ntraffickers may invest the illicit proceeds in high-value assets, such as real estate and cars.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n4\n2.  Exploitative Employment Practices \nSome seemingly legitimate businesses use exploitative employment schemes, such as visa fraud and \nwage retention, to amass profit from labor and sex trafficking.  For instance, some labor recruiters \nmislead or defraud victims, taking advantage of workers before and after they enter the United States.  \nSome labor recruiters also mislead workers about the conditions and nature of a job, engage in contract \nswitching, and confiscate or destroy workers’ identity documents.14  Foreign nationals who have \nlegitimate temporary work or student visas also can be exploited.15\nAnother common practice is to charge exploitative fees to workers by withholding their salary \nor paying less than promised.  The trafficker claims that the fees cover the costs of recruitment \nor access to job opportunities.16  Recruitment fees can range from hundreds of dollars to tens of \nthousands of dollars, and take years to repay.17  Victims’ salaries are transferred to the traffickers \nor their co-conspirators via teller checks or wire transfers.  Proceeds also can be “disguised” as a \nlegitimate business expense, such as a cleaning service.  Financial institutions may see multiple \nemployees receiving their salaries in the same account, or payment for employment may be \nfollowed by immediate withdrawal or transfer into another account.18\n3.  Funnel Accounts \nFunnel accounts generally involve an individual or business account in one geographic area \nthat receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, from \nwhich the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between \nthe deposits and withdrawals.19  Human traffickers may use interstate funnel accounts to transfer \nfunds between geographic areas, move proceeds rapidly, and maintain anonymity.20  In labor and \nsex trafficking schemes, human traffickers may open accounts in their name, or escort victims to \na bank, and force them to open an account.21  Traffickers maintain control of the victims’ bank \naccounts through coercion, and direct victims to deposit money into their accounts and other \naccounts that the traffickers can access.22  In some cases, victims also are coerced or forced to wire \nproceeds via money services businesses (MSBs) to facilitate the funneling of proceeds.   \n14.\t U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017); see also U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, “Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February \n25, 2016).\n15.\t U.S. Department of Justice, Journal of Federal Law and Practice, “Human Trafficking,” Executive Office of United \nStates Attorneys, pp. 5 and 28, (November 2017).\n16.\t For more information see U.S. Department of Justice, “Leader of Human Trafficking Organization Sentenced to Over \n15 Years for Exploiting Guatemalan Migrants at Ohio Egg Farms,” (June 27, 2016); and U.S. Department of Justice, \n“Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February 25, 2016).  \n17.\t See U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017).\n18.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 28, (July 2018).\n19.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A005, “Update on U.S. Currency Restrictions in Mexico: Funnel Accounts and TBML,” \np. 1, (May 28, 2014).  \n20.\t See U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking,” \n(January 29, 2015).\n21.\t For additional behavioral indicators of human trafficking, see Section II, infra.\n22.\t Policies of certain large national banks to restrict third-party cash deposits for private customer accounts seem to have \nlessened the use of funnel account activity.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n5\nCase Study: Funnel Accounts Facilitate International Thai Sex Trafficking Ring\n4.  Alternative Payment Methods \nIn addition to payment via cash, traffickers also have accepted payment via credit cards, prepaid \ncards,23 mobile payment applications, and convertible virtual currency.24  Buyers of commercial \nsex use prepaid cards—a method of payment using funds paid in advance, which can be acquired \nanonymously with cash or on darknet websites—to register with escort websites and to purchase \nsexual services, flights, throw-away phones, and hotel rooms.25\nIllicit actors also use virtual currency to advertise commercial sex online.  For example, human \ntraffickers have purchased prepaid cards, and then used the cards to purchase virtual currency on \na peer-to-peer exchange platform.  Human traffickers then use the virtual currency to buy online \nadvertisements that feature commercial sex acts to obtain customers.26\nFinCEN also has identified transactions in which human traffickers use third-party payment \nprocessors (TPPPs) to wire funds, which gives the appearance that the TPPP is the originator or \nbeneficiary of the wire transfer and conceals the true originator or beneficiary.  For example, human \ntraffickers facilitate payments via TPPPs for the operation of online escort services and online \nstreaming services that use voice-over Internet protocol technology.  Human traffickers and their \nfacilitators use TPPPs to wire funds to individuals or businesses both domestically and abroad.27\nCase Study: Trafficking Involving Prepaid Cards and Bitcoin\nII.  Behavioral and Financial Red Flag Indicators \nof Human Trafficking\nIn applying the red flags below and the red flags in the 2014 Advisory, financial institutions are \nadvised that no single red flag is a clear indicator of human trafficking activity, although each can \nbe indicative of forced labor and/or sex trafficking.  Given that human trafficking is a predicate \noffense to money laundering, the financial red flags also may be indicative of other money \nlaundering-related offenses.  Financial institutions should consider additional factors, such as \na customer’s previous financial activity and the existence of typologies or other red flags, when \ndetermining whether transactions may be associated with human trafficking.  \n23.\t See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “National Money Laundering Risk Assessment,” p. 15-16, (2018).\n24.\t For more information about illicit activity involving convertible virtual currency see FinCEN Advisory, \nFIN-2019-A003, “Advisory on Illicit Activity Involving Convertible Virtual Currency,” (May 9, 2019).\n25.\t See New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s testimony, “Following the Money: How Human Traffickers \nExploit the U.S. Financial Markets: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the \nCommittee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives,” (January 30, 2018).

The only outside contact they may have is when visiting financial institutions such as \nbank branches, check cashing counters, or money wiring services.  Consequently, it is important that \ncustomer-facing staff consider the following behavioral indicators when conducting transactions,28 \nparticularly those that also present financial indicators of human trafficking schemes discussed \nbelow.  As appropriate, such information should be incorporated into Suspicious Activity Report \n(SAR) filings and/or reported to law enforcement.29  When incorporated into SAR filings, it is \nimportant that behavioral indicators, and the staff who witnessed them, are included in the SAR \nnarrative so that information may be effectively searched for, and later used by, law enforcement.  \nThis list is not exhaustive and is only a selection of behavioral indicators:30\n\tA third party speaks on behalf of the customer (a third party may insist on being present and/\nor translating).\n\tA third party insists on being present for every aspect of the transaction.  \n\tA third party attempts to fill out paperwork without consulting the customer.\n\tA third party maintains possession and/or control of all documents or money.\n\tA third party claims to be related to the customer, but does not know critical details.\n\tA prospective customer uses, or attempts to use, third-party identification (of someone who is \nnot present) to open an account.  \n\tA third party attempts to open an account for an unqualified minor.\n\tA third party commits acts of physical aggression or intimidation toward the customer.  \n\tA customer shows signs of poor hygiene, malnourishment, fatigue, signs of physical and/or \nsexual abuse, physical restraint, confinement, or torture.\n\tA customer shows lack of knowledge of their whereabouts, cannot clarify where they live or \nwhere they are staying, or provides scripted, confusing, or inconsistent stories in response to \ninquiry.\n28.\t Additional resources discussing human trafficking and the role of financial institutions include the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security, Blue Campaign, “Resources Page”; U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Combatting Human \nTrafficking,” (January, 29, 2020); U.S. Department of State, “Tracking Suspicious Financial Activity to Address Human \nTrafficking,” (June 28, 2018); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to \nCombat Human Trafficking,” (January 29, 2015); and Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human \nTrafficking,” (July 2018).  \n29.\t To report suspicious activity indicative of human trafficking to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line, call 1-866-DHS-2-ICE (1-866-347-2423) 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek, every day of the year.

Assess the bank’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the \nreporting of international shipments of currency or monetary instruments. \nEach person145 (including a bank) who physically transports, mails, or ships currency or \nmonetary instruments in excess of $10,000 at one time out of or into the United States (and \neach person who causes such transportation, mailing, or shipment) must file a Report of \nInternational Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR).146 A CMIR must \nbe filed with the appropriate Bureau of Customs and Border Protection officer or with the \ncommissioner of Customs at the time of entry into or departure from the United States.  \nWhen a person receives currency or monetary instruments in an amount exceeding $10,000 \nat one time that have been shipped from any place outside the United States, a CMIR must be \nfiled with the appropriate Bureau of Customs and Border Protection officer or with the \ncommissioner of Customs within 15 days of receipt of the instruments (unless a report has \nalready been filed).  The report is to be completed by or on behalf of the person requesting \ntransfer of the currency or monetary instruments.  However, banks are not required to report \nthese items on a CMIR if they are mailed or shipped through the postal service or by \ncommon carrier.147 In addition, a commercial bank or trust company organized under the \nlaws of any state or of the United States is not required to report overland shipments of \ncurrency or monetary instruments if they are shipped to or received from an established \ncustomer maintaining a deposit relationship with the bank and if the bank reasonably \nconcludes the amounts do not exceed what is commensurate with the customary conduct of \nthe business, industry, or profession of the customer concerned. \nRegardless of whether an exemption from filing a CMIR applies, banks are not relieved of \nother monitoring and reporting obligations under the BSA.  Banks must report the receipt or \ndisbursement of currency in excess of $10,000 on a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) \nsubject to the exemptions at 31 CFR 1020.315.  Banks must also monitor for and report \nsuspicious activity. \n145 As defined in 31 CFR 1010.100 (mm), the term “person” means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a \ntrust or estate, a joint stock company, an association, a syndicate, joint venture or other unincorporated \norganization or group, an Indian Tribe (as that term is defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act), and all \nentities cognizable as legal personalities. \n146 The obligation to file the CMIR is solely on the person who transports, mails, ships or receives, or causes or \nattempts to transport, mail, ship, or receive.  No other person is under any obligation to file a CMIR.  Thus, if a \ncustomer walks into the bank and declares that he or she has received or transported currency in an aggregate \namount exceeding $10,000 from a place outside the United States and wishes to deposit the currency into his or \nher account, the bank is under no obligation to file a CMIR on the customer’s behalf (see FIN-1998-R002 \nformerly known as Treasury Administrative Ruling 88-2).  Also refer to CMIR guidance for common carriers of \ncurrency, including armored car services, FIN-2014-G002, August 1, 2014. \n147 In contrast, a bank is required to file a CMIR to report shipments of currency or monetary instruments to \nforeign offices when those shipments are performed directly by bank personnel, such as currency shipments \nhandled by bank employees using bank-owned vehicles.', 'Trade Finance Activities — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n269 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nRisk Mitigation \nSound CDD procedures are needed to gain a thorough understanding of the customer’s \nunderlying business and locations served.  The banks in the letter of credit process need to \nundertake varying degrees of due diligence depending upon their role in the transaction.  For \nexample, Issuing Banks should conduct sufficient due diligence on a prospective customer \nbefore establishing the letter of credit.  The due diligence should include gathering sufficient \ninformation on Applicants and Beneficiaries, including their identities, nature of business, \nand sources of funding.  This may require the use of background checks or investigations, \nparticularly in higher-risk jurisdictions.  As such, banks should conduct a thorough review \nand reasonably know their customers prior to facilitating trade-related activity and should \nhave a thorough understanding of trade finance documentation.  Refer to the core overview \nsection, “Customer Due Diligence,” page 56, for additional guidance. \nLikewise, guidance provided by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering \n(FATF) has helped set important industry standards and is a resource for banks that provide \ntrade finance services.242 The Wolfsberg Group also has published suggested industry \nstandards and guidance for banks that provide trade finance services.243 \nBanks taking other roles in the letter of credit process should complete due diligence that is \ncommensurate with their roles in each transaction.  Banks need to be aware that because of \nthe frequency of transactions in which multiple banks are involved, Issuing Banks may not \nalways have correspondent relationships with the Advising or Confirming Bank. \nTo the extent feasible, banks should review documentation, not only for compliance with the \nterms of the letter of credit, but also for anomalies or red flags that could indicate unusual or \nsuspicious activity.  Reliable documentation is critical in identifying potentially suspicious \nactivity.  When analyzing trade transactions for unusual or suspicious activity, banks should \nconsider obtaining copies of official U.S. or foreign government import and export forms to \nassess the reliability of documentation provided.244 These anomalies could appear in shipping \ndocumentation, obvious under- or over-invoicing, government licenses (when required), or \ndiscrepancies in the description of goods on various documents.  Identification of these \nelements may not, in itself, require the filing of a SAR, but may suggest the need for further \nresearch and verification.  In circumstances where a SAR is warranted, the bank is not \nexpected to stop trade or discontinue processing the transaction.  However, stopping the trade \nmay be required to avoid a potential violation of an OFAC sanction. \nTrade finance transactions frequently use Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial \nTelecommunication (SWIFT) messages.  U.S. banks must comply with OFAC regulations, \nand when necessary, licensing in advance of funding.  Banks should monitor the names of \nthe parties contained in these messages and compare the names against OFAC lists.  Refer to \n242 Refer to the Financial Action Task Force’s report on Trade Based Money Laundering, June 23, 2006 and the \nAsia Pacific Group Typology Report on Trade Base Money Laundering, July 20, 2012.    \n243 Refer to The Wolfsberg Trade Finance Principles, 2011. \n244 For instance, refer to U.S. Customs and Border Protection Form 7501 (Entry Summary)  and U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce Form 7525-V (Shipper’s Export Declaration) classify all U.S. imports and exports by \n10-digit harmonized codes.', 'Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n317 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nestablished using bearer shares; ownership records are not maintained, rather ownership is \nbased on physical possession of the stock certificates.

These transactions, primarily funds transfers circling in \nand out of the U.S. banking system, evidenced no apparent business purpose.  Domestic \nbusiness entities with bank-like names, but without regulatory authority to conduct banking, \nshould be particularly suspect.299 \nThe following indicators of potentially suspicious activity may be commonly associated with \nshell company activity: \n•\nInsufficient or no information available to positively identify originators or beneficiaries\nof funds transfers (using Internet, commercial database searches, or direct inquiries to a\nrespondent bank).\n•\nPayments have no stated purpose, do not reference goods or services, or identify only a\ncontract or invoice number.\n•\nGoods or services, if identified, do not match profile of company provided by respondent\nbank or character of the financial activity; a company references remarkably dissimilar\ngoods and services in related funds transfers; explanation given by foreign respondent\nbank is inconsistent with observed funds transfer activity.\n•\nTransacting businesses share the same address, provide only a registered agent’s address,\nor other address inconsistencies.\n•\nMany or all of the funds transfers are sent in large, round dollar, hundred dollar, or\nthousand dollar amounts.\n•\nUnusually large number and variety of beneficiaries receiving funds transfers from one\ncompany.\n•\nFrequent involvement of multiple jurisdictions or beneficiaries located in higher-risk\nOFCs.\n•\nA foreign correspondent bank exceeds the expected volume in its client profile for funds\ntransfers, or an individual company exhibits a high volume and pattern of funds transfers\nthat is inconsistent with its normal business activity.\n298 Failure to Identify Company Owners Impedes Law Enforcement.

Assess the bank’s compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements to \nimplement policies, procedures, and controls to detect and report money laundering and \nsuspicious activity through private banking accounts established, administered, or \nmaintained for non-U.S. persons.  Refer to the expanded sections of the manual for \ndiscussions and examination procedures regarding specific money laundering risks \nassociated with private banking. \nPrivate banking can be broadly defined as providing personalized financial services to \nwealthy clients.  Section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act added subsection (i) to 31 USC \n5318 of the BSA.  This subsection requires each U.S. financial institution that establishes, \nmaintains, administers, or manages a private banking account in the United States for a non-\nU.S. person to take certain AML measures with respect to these accounts.  In particular, a \nbank must establish appropriate, specific, and, where necessary, EDD policies, procedures, \nand controls that are reasonably designed to enable the bank to detect and report instances of \nmoney laundering through such accounts.  In addition, section 312 mandates enhanced \nscrutiny to detect and, if appropriate, report transactions that may involve proceeds of foreign \ncorruption for private banking accounts that are requested or maintained by or on behalf of a \nsenior foreign political figure or the individual’s immediate family and close associates.  On \nJanuary 4, 2006, FinCEN issued a final regulation (31 CFR 1010.620) to implement the \nprivate banking requirements of 31 USC 5318(i). \nThe overview and examination procedures set forth in this section are intended to evaluate \nthe bank’s due diligence program concerning private banking accounts offered to non-U.S. \npersons.  Additional procedures for specific risk areas of private banking are included in the \nexpanded examination procedures, “Private Banking,” page 278. \nPrivate Banking Accounts \nFor purposes of 31 CFR 1010.620 a “private banking account” is an account (or any \ncombination of accounts) maintained at a bank that satisfies all three of the following criteria: \n•\nRequires a minimum aggregate deposit of funds or other assets of not less than\n$1 million.\n•\nIs established on behalf of or for the benefit of one or more non-U.S. persons who are\ndirect or beneficial owners132 of the account.\n132 “Beneficial owner” of an account means an individual who has a level of control over, or entitlement to, the \nfunds or assets in the account that, as a practical matter, enables the individual, directly or indirectly, to control, \nmanage, or direct the account.  The ability to fund the account or the entitlement to the funds of the account \nalone, however, without any corresponding authority to control, manage, or direct the account (such as in the \ncase of a minor child beneficiary), does not cause the individual to be a beneficial owner (31 CFR 1010.605(a). \nGuidance on Obtaining and Retaining Beneficial Ownership Information, was issued by FinCEN, Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), \nNational Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Office of \nThrift Supervision (OTS), and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in consultation with the U.S.', 'Bulk Shipments of Currency — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n185 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nways to re-integrate the currency into the global banking system.  Often, this occurs through \nthe use of a foreign financial institution, many times a money services business, that \nwittingly or unwittingly receives the illicit U.S.-dollar denominated proceeds, and then \noriginates a cash letter instrument (or a funds transfer) for processing by, or deposit into, a \nU.S. bank.  The foreign financial institution then initiates the process of physically \nrepatriating (shipping) the cash back into the United States.186 Experience has shown a direct \ncorrelation between the smuggling of bulk currency, the heightened use of wire transfers, \nremote deposit capture (RDC) transactions or cash letter instruments from certain foreign \nfinancial institutions and/or jurisdictions, and bulk shipments of currency into the United \nStates from the same foreign financial institutions or jurisdictions.187  \nThe activity of shipping currency in bulk is not necessarily indicative of criminal or terrorist \nactivity.  Many individuals and businesses, both domestic and foreign, generate currency \nfrom legitimate cash sales of commodities or other products or services or certain industries \nsuch as tourism or commerce.  Also, intermediaries gather and ship currency from single or \nmultiple currency originators whose activities are legitimate.  Banks may legitimately offer \nservices to receive such shipments.  However, banks should be aware of the potential misuse \nof their services by shippers of bulk currency.  Banks should also guard against introducing \nthe monetary proceeds of criminal or terrorist activity into the financial system.  Banks \nshould have a clear understanding of the appropriate volumes of currency shipments that are \ncommensurate with the currency originator’s or shipper’s profile (size, location, strategic \nfocus, customer base, geographic footprint) and the economic activity that generates the cash. \nTo inform banks on the topic of bulk currency shipments, FinCEN has issued a number of \nadvisories that set forth certain activities that may be associated with currency smuggling.188 \nAccording to FinCEN, U.S. law enforcement has observed a dramatic increase in the \nsmuggling of bulk cash proceeds from the sale of narcotics and other criminal activities from \nthe United States into Mexico.  Although the FinCEN advisories deal specifically with the \nshipment of bulk currency to and from the United States and Mexico, the issues discussed \ncould be pertinent to shipping bulk currency to and from other jurisdictions as well.  Banks \nshould look at each situation on a case by case basis. \nLaw enforcement has identified the following activities that, in various combinations, may be \nassociated with currency smuggling:189 \n186 In certain cases, the foreign financial institution will ship the cash to its central bank or a money center bank \nin the foreign country in which the cash letter instrument originated.  Sometimes numerous layered transactions \nare used to disguise the origins of the cash, after which the currency may be returned directly to the United \nStates or further shipped to or through other jurisdictions.  The cash will be repatriated back to the United States \nfor the account of the U.S. bank in which the cash letter instrument was processed or funds transfer deposit was \nmade. \n187 For an example of these types of transactions, refer to National Drug Intelligence Center’s National Drug \nThreat Assessment 2008, Illicit Finance (December 2007). \n188 Refer to FinCEN’s Website for advisories on the shipment of bulk currency to and from the United States. \n189 Id.', 'Bulk Shipments of Currency — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n184 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nintermediaries that ship currency gathered from other shippers, who in turn are gathering \ncurrency from their customers who are currency originators.  Intermediaries may be other \nbanks, central banks, nondeposit financial institutions, or agents of these entities. \nBanks receive bulk shipments of currency directly when they take possession of an actual \nshipment.  Banks receive bulk shipments of currency indirectly when they take possession of \nthe economic equivalent of a currency shipment, such as through a cash letter notification or \ndeposit into the bank’s account at the Federal Reserve.  In the case of a shipment received \nindirectly, the actual shipment usually moves toward the bank only as far as a Federal \nReserve Bank or branch, where the value of the currency becomes recorded as held on the \nbank’s behalf.  Whether the shipment to or from the bank is direct or indirect, banks are \nrequired to report the receipt or disbursement of currency in excess of $10,000 via a \nCurrency Transaction Report (CTR) (31 CFR 1010.311) subject to the exemptions at 31 CFR \n1020.315.  Note that most categories of CTR exempt persons apply only to the extent of the \nexempt person’s domestic operations, 31 CFR 1020.315(b)(1-7).  For more information on \nCTRs refer to the Currency Transaction Reporting Overview on page 81. \nReport of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments \nSubject to certain exemptions, each person who physically transports, mails or ships, or \ncauses to be physically transported, mailed, or shipped currency or other monetary \ninstruments, is required to report shipments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 \nreceived from or shipped to locations outside the U.S. via a Report of International \nTransportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR) (31 CFR 1010.340)  For more \ninformation on CMIRs refer to the International Transportation of Currency or Monetary \nInstruments Overview on page 139.   \nRegardless of whether an exemption from filing a CMIR or CTR applies, banks must still \nmonitor for, and report, suspicious activity.   \nRisk Factors \nBulk shipments of currency to banks from shippers that are presumed to be reputable may \nnevertheless originate from illicit activity.  The monetary proceeds of criminal activities, for \nexample, often reappear in the financial system as seemingly legitimate funds that have been \nplaced and finally integrated by flowing through numerous intermediaries and layered \ntransactions that disguise the origin of the funds.  Layering can include shipments to or \nthrough other jurisdictions.  Accordingly, banks that receive direct or indirect bulk shipments \nof currency risk becoming complicit in money laundering or terrorist financing schemes.  \nIn recent years, the smuggling of bulk currency has become a preferred method for moving \nillicit funds across borders.185  Because bulk cash that is smuggled out of the United States is \nusually denominated in U.S. dollars, those who receive the smuggled bulk cash must find \n185 Refer to U.S. Money Laundering Threat Assessment (December 2005) on page 33.  Congress criminalized \nthe act of smuggling large amounts of cash as part of the USA PATRIOT Act.  Specifically, 31 USC 5332-Bulk \nCash Smuggling makes it a crime to smuggle or attempt to smuggle over $10,000 in currency or other monetary \ninstruments into or out of the United States, with the specific intent to evade the U.S. currency-reporting \nrequirements codified in 31 USC 5316.', '21\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\nSAR Activity Review — Trends, Tips & Issues (Issue 22)\nThis section of The SAR Activity Review discusses current issues, including those raised \nwith regard to the preparation and filing of SARs, and provides guidance to filers.  \nProject STAMP (Smugglers’ and Traffickers’ \nAssets, Monies and Proceeds)\nBy United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland \nSecurity Investigations\nProject Smugglers’ and Traffickers’ Assets, Monies and Proceeds (Project STAMP) \nis a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security \nInvestigations’ (HSI) enforcement initiative aimed at targeting the illicit proceeds \nearned by human smuggling and human trafficking (HS/HT) organizations.

"I need know what U.S. Department of Labor do with forced labor goods, like how they handle it and what they keep track of, can you explain what they do about that, cause I got to make sure our SARs got right info for compliance?","The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) plays a significant role in addressing the issue of goods produced by forced or child labor. Here's how they handle it and what they keep track of:

1. **List of Goods Produced by Forced or Child Labor**: The DOL maintains a list of goods and their source countries that are believed to be produced by forced or child labor. This list is part of their efforts to comply with international standards and to inform the public and relevant stakeholders about the origins of certain goods. The list serves as a tool for raising awareness and guiding policy and enforcement actions.

2. **Collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)**: The DOL works in conjunction with the CBP, which issues Withhold Release Orders (WROs) against imported merchandise suspected of being produced with forced or child labor. These orders prevent the entry of such goods into the United States until the importer can prove that the goods were not produced with forced labor.

3. **Regulatory Framework and Enforcement**: The DOL's efforts are part of a broader regulatory framework that includes various U.S. laws and international agreements aimed at combating human trafficking and forced labor. This includes the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 and other relevant statutes.

4. **Financial Monitoring and Reporting**: The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and other agencies provide guidance on identifying and reporting suspicious financial activities related to human trafficking and forced labor. Financial institutions are required to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) when they detect transactions that may involve proceeds from such activities. These reports are crucial for law enforcement investigations and efforts to combat human trafficking.

5. **Awareness and Training**: The DOL, along with other agencies, emphasizes the importance of training and awareness for identifying and reporting suspicious activities. This includes understanding the financial indicators of human trafficking and forced labor, such as unusual transaction patterns and the use of funnel accounts.

6. **Confidentiality and Information Sharing**: There are strict regulations regarding the confidentiality of SARs and the information they contain. Financial institutions must ensure that SARs are not disclosed to unauthorized parties, and they must have procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of these reports.

For compliance purposes, it's important to ensure that your Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) accurately reflect any potential involvement with goods produced by forced or child labor. This includes being aware of the DOL's list of goods, understanding the financial indicators of forced labor, and maintaining the confidentiality of SARs as required by law.","['imported into the United States.

Exploitative Employment Practices \nSome seemingly legitimate businesses use exploitative employment schemes, such as visa fraud and \nwage retention, to amass profit from labor and sex trafficking.  For instance, some labor recruiters \nmislead or defraud victims, taking advantage of workers before and after they enter the United States.  \nSome labor recruiters also mislead workers about the conditions and nature of a job, engage in contract \nswitching, and confiscate or destroy workers’ identity documents.14  Foreign nationals who have \nlegitimate temporary work or student visas also can be exploited.15\nAnother common practice is to charge exploitative fees to workers by withholding their salary \nor paying less than promised.  The trafficker claims that the fees cover the costs of recruitment \nor access to job opportunities.16  Recruitment fees can range from hundreds of dollars to tens of \nthousands of dollars, and take years to repay.17  Victims’ salaries are transferred to the traffickers \nor their co-conspirators via teller checks or wire transfers.  Proceeds also can be “disguised” as a \nlegitimate business expense, such as a cleaning service.  Financial institutions may see multiple \nemployees receiving their salaries in the same account, or payment for employment may be \nfollowed by immediate withdrawal or transfer into another account.18\n3.  Funnel Accounts \nFunnel accounts generally involve an individual or business account in one geographic area \nthat receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, from \nwhich the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between \nthe deposits and withdrawals.19  Human traffickers may use interstate funnel accounts to transfer \nfunds between geographic areas, move proceeds rapidly, and maintain anonymity.20  In labor and \nsex trafficking schemes, human traffickers may open accounts in their name, or escort victims to \na bank, and force them to open an account.21  Traffickers maintain control of the victims’ bank \naccounts through coercion, and direct victims to deposit money into their accounts and other \naccounts that the traffickers can access.22  In some cases, victims also are coerced or forced to wire \nproceeds via money services businesses (MSBs) to facilitate the funneling of proceeds.   \n14.\t U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017); see also U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, “Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February \n25, 2016).\n15.\t U.S. Department of Justice, Journal of Federal Law and Practice, “Human Trafficking,” Executive Office of United \nStates Attorneys, pp. 5 and 28, (November 2017).\n16.\t For more information see U.S. Department of Justice, “Leader of Human Trafficking Organization Sentenced to Over \n15 Years for Exploiting Guatemalan Migrants at Ohio Egg Farms,” (June 27, 2016); and U.S. Department of Justice, \n“Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February 25, 2016).  \n17.\t See U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017).\n18.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 28, (July 2018).\n19.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A005, “Update on U.S. Currency Restrictions in Mexico: Funnel Accounts and TBML,” \np. 1, (May 28, 2014).  \n20.\t See U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking,” \n(January 29, 2015).\n21.\t For additional behavioral indicators of human trafficking, see Section II, infra.\n22.\t Policies of certain large national banks to restrict third-party cash deposits for private customer accounts seem to have \nlessened the use of funnel account activity.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n7\nFinancial Indicators \nTo help identify and report transactions possibly associated with human trafficking, FinCEN \nhas identified 10 new financial red flag indicators.  These red flags do not replace the red flags \nidentified in the 2014 Advisory, all of which remain relevant.31  The Financial Action Task Force \nreport on the “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking” also provides numerous indicators of \nmoney laundering related to human trafficking.32\n\tCustomers frequently appear to move through, and transact from, different geographic \nlocations in the United States.  These transactions can be combined with travel and \ntransactions in and to foreign countries that are significant conduits for human trafficking.33\n\tTransactions are inconsistent with a customer’s expected activity and/or line of business in \nan apparent effort to cover trafficking victims’ living costs, including housing (e.g., hotel, \nmotel, short-term rentals, or residential accommodations), transportation (e.g., airplane, taxi, \nlimousine, or rideshare services), medical expenses, pharmacies, clothing, grocery stores, and \nrestaurants, to include fast food eateries.   \n\tTransactional activity largely occurs outside of normal business operating hours (e.g., an \nestablishment that operates during the day has a large number of transactions at night), is \nalmost always made in cash, and deposits are larger than what is expected for the business \nand the size of its operations.  \n\tA customer frequently makes cash deposits with no Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments. \n\tAn individual frequently purchases and uses prepaid access cards.  \n\tA customer’s account shares common identifiers, such as a telephone number, email, and \nsocial media handle, or address, associated with escort agency websites and commercial sex \nadvertisements.\n\tFrequent transactions with online classified sites that are based in foreign jurisdictions.  \n\tA customer frequently sends or receives funds via cryptocurrency to or from darknet markets \nor services known to be associated with illicit activity.  This may include services that host \nadvertising content for illicit services, sell illicit content, or financial institutions that allow \nprepaid cards to pay for cryptocurrencies without appropriate risk mitigation controls.\n\tFrequent transactions using third-party payment processors that conceal the originators and/\nor beneficiaries of the transactions.  \n\tA customer avoids transactions that require identification documents or that trigger reporting \nrequirements.\n31.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A008, “Guidance on Recognizing Activity that May be Associated with Human \nSmuggling and Human Trafficking – Financial Red Flags,” (September 11, 2014).\n32.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” pp. 65-70, (July 2018).\n33.\t For information on specific countries, and whether they are conduits for human trafficking, see U.S. Department of \nState, “Trafficking in Persons Report,” (June 2019).', '42\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\nSAR Activity Review — Trends, Tips & Issues (Issue 22)\naccount was opened, the account number and its licensing and registration status at \nthe time of this filing.

The only outside contact they may have is when visiting financial institutions such as \nbank branches, check cashing counters, or money wiring services.  Consequently, it is important that \ncustomer-facing staff consider the following behavioral indicators when conducting transactions,28 \nparticularly those that also present financial indicators of human trafficking schemes discussed \nbelow.  As appropriate, such information should be incorporated into Suspicious Activity Report \n(SAR) filings and/or reported to law enforcement.29  When incorporated into SAR filings, it is \nimportant that behavioral indicators, and the staff who witnessed them, are included in the SAR \nnarrative so that information may be effectively searched for, and later used by, law enforcement.  \nThis list is not exhaustive and is only a selection of behavioral indicators:30\n\tA third party speaks on behalf of the customer (a third party may insist on being present and/\nor translating).\n\tA third party insists on being present for every aspect of the transaction.  \n\tA third party attempts to fill out paperwork without consulting the customer.\n\tA third party maintains possession and/or control of all documents or money.\n\tA third party claims to be related to the customer, but does not know critical details.\n\tA prospective customer uses, or attempts to use, third-party identification (of someone who is \nnot present) to open an account.  \n\tA third party attempts to open an account for an unqualified minor.\n\tA third party commits acts of physical aggression or intimidation toward the customer.  \n\tA customer shows signs of poor hygiene, malnourishment, fatigue, signs of physical and/or \nsexual abuse, physical restraint, confinement, or torture.\n\tA customer shows lack of knowledge of their whereabouts, cannot clarify where they live or \nwhere they are staying, or provides scripted, confusing, or inconsistent stories in response to \ninquiry.\n28.\t Additional resources discussing human trafficking and the role of financial institutions include the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security, Blue Campaign, “Resources Page”; U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Combatting Human \nTrafficking,” (January, 29, 2020); U.S. Department of State, “Tracking Suspicious Financial Activity to Address Human \nTrafficking,” (June 28, 2018); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to \nCombat Human Trafficking,” (January 29, 2015); and Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human \nTrafficking,” (July 2018).  \n29.\t To report suspicious activity indicative of human trafficking to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line, call 1-866-DHS-2-ICE (1-866-347-2423) 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek, every day of the year.

Typically, these agencies requested FinCEN data so frequently that they \ntended to overburden the state coordinators.  Based on the agencies’ mission and \nuse of the data, FinCEN provides access to ensure that BSA material is used to its \nfullest extent.\nInsurance Fraud\n“I am a crime intelligence analyst in the fraud division currently assisting my detective on \na worker’s compensation case that involves a check cashing company.

Intelligent systems review transactions in context with other transactions and the \ncustomer profile.  In doing so, these systems increase their information database on the \ncustomer, account type, category, or business, as more transactions and data are stored in the \nsystem. \nRelative to surveillance monitoring, system capabilities and thresholds refer to the \nparameters or filters used by banks in their monitoring processes.  Parameters and filters \nshould be reasonable and tailored to the activity that the bank is trying to identify or control.  \nAfter parameters and filters have been developed, they should be reviewed before \nimplementation to identify any gaps (common money laundering techniques or frauds) that \nmay not have been addressed.  For example, a bank may discover that its filter for cash \nstructuring is triggered only by a daily cash transaction in excess of $10,000.  The bank may \nneed to refine this filter in order to avoid missing potentially suspicious activity because \ncommon cash structuring techniques often involve transactions that are slightly under the \nCTR threshold.   \nOnce established, the bank should review and test system capabilities and thresholds on a \nperiodic basis.  This review should focus on specific parameters or filters in order to ensure \nthat intended information is accurately captured and that the parameter or filter is appropriate \nfor the bank’s particular risk profile. \nUnderstanding the filtering criteria of a surveillance monitoring system is critical to assessing \nthe effectiveness of the system.  System filtering criteria should be developed through a \nreview of specific higher-risk products and services, customers and entities, and geographies.  \nSystem filtering criteria, including specific profiles and rules, should be based on what is \nreasonable and expected for each type of account.  Monitoring accounts purely based on \nhistorical activity can be misleading if the activity is not actually consistent with similar \ntypes of accounts.  For example, an account may have a historical transaction activity that is \nsubstantially different from what would normally be expected from that type of account (e.g., \na check-cashing business that deposits large sums of currency versus withdrawing currency \nto fund the cashing of checks). \nThe authority to establish or change expected activity profiles should be clearly defined \nthrough policies and procedures.  Controls should ensure limited access to the monitoring \nsystems, and changes should generally require the approval of the BSA compliance officer or \nsenior management.  Management should document and be able to explain filtering criteria, \nthresholds used, and how both are appropriate for the bank’s risks.  Management should also \nperiodically review and test the filtering criteria and thresholds established to ensure that they \nare still effective.  In addition, the monitoring system’s programming methodology and \neffectiveness should be independently validated to ensure that the models are detecting \npotentially suspicious activity.  The independent validation should also verify the policies in \nplace and that management is complying with those policies.', 'Appendix R: Enforcement Guidance \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \nR–5 \n2/27/2015.V2 \naction involving adoption or conversion of computer systems.

As noted above, \nin addition to the situations described in this Statement where an Agency will issue a cease \nand desist order for a violation of the BSA Compliance Program regulation or for failure to \ncorrect a previously reported Program “problem,” an Agency may also issue a cease and \ndesist order or enter into a formal written agreement, or take informal enforcement action \nagainst an institution for other types of BSA/AML Program concerns.  In these situations, \ndepending upon the particular facts involved, an Agency may pursue enforcement actions \nbased on unsafe and unsound practices or violations of law, including the BSA.  The form of \nthe enforcement action in a particular case will depend on the severity of the noncompliance, \nweaknesses, or deficiencies, the capability and cooperation of the institution’s management, \nand the Agency’s confidence that the institution will take appropriate and timely corrective \naction.  \nBSA Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements \nSuspicious activity reporting requirements.  Under regulations of the Agencies and the \nTreasury Department, organizations subject to the Agencies’ supervision are required to file \na SAR when they detect certain known or suspected criminal violations or suspicious \ntransactions.316 Suspicious activity reporting forms the cornerstone of the BSA reporting \nsystem, and is critical to the United States’ ability to utilize financial information to combat \nmoney laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.  The regulations require \nbanking organizations and credit unions to file SARs with respect to the following general \ntypes of activity: \n•\nKnown or suspected criminal violations involving insider activity in any amount;\n•\nKnown or suspected criminal violations aggregating $5,000 or more when a suspect can\nbe identified;\n•\nKnown or suspected criminal violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of\npotential suspects; or\n•\nSuspicious transactions of $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or\nBSA violations.\nThe SAR must be filed within 30 days of detecting facts that may constitute a basis for filing \na SAR (or within 60 days if there is no subject). \nThe Agencies will cite a violation of the SAR regulations, and will take appropriate \nsupervisory action, if the organization’s failure to file a SAR (or SARs) evidences a systemic \nbreakdown in its policies, procedures, or processes to identify and research suspicious \n316 12 CFR 21.11 and 12 CFR 163.180 (OCC); 12 CFR 208.62, 12 CFR 211.5(k), 12 CFR 211.24(f), 12 CFR \n225.4(f) (Board of Governors); 12 CFR 353 (FDIC); 12 CFR 748.1(c) (NCUA); 31 CFR 1020.320 (Treasury).', 'Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n63 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nMere receipt of any law enforcement inquiry does not, by itself, require the filing of a SAR \nby the bank.  Nonetheless, a law enforcement inquiry may be relevant to a bank’s overall risk \nassessment of its customers and accounts.  For example, the receipt of a grand jury subpoena \nshould cause a bank to review account activity for the relevant customer.58 A bank should \nassess all of the information it knows about its customer, including the receipt of a law \nenforcement inquiry, in accordance with its risk-based BSA/AML compliance program. \nThe bank should determine whether a SAR should be filed based on all customer information \navailable.  Due to the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings, if a bank files a SAR after \nreceiving a grand jury subpoena, law enforcement discourages banks from including any \nreference to the receipt or existence of the grand jury subpoena in the SAR.  Rather, the SAR \nshould reference only those facts and activities that support a finding of suspicious \ntransactions identified by the bank. \nNational Security Letters \nNSLs are written investigative demands that may be issued by the local Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) and other federal governmental authorities in counterintelligence and \ncounterterrorism investigations to obtain the following: \n•\nTelephone and electronic communications records from telephone companies and\nInternet service providers.59\n•\nInformation from credit bureaus.60\n•\nFinancial records from financial institutions.61\nNSLs are highly confidential documents; for that reason, examiners do not review or sample \nspecific NSLs.62 Pursuant to 12 USC 3414(a)(3) and (5)(D), no bank, or officer, employee or \nagent of the institution, can disclose to any person that a government authority or the FBI has \nsought or obtained access to records through a Right to Financial Privacy Act NSL.  Banks \nthat receive NSLs must take appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality of the letters \nand should have procedures in place for processing and maintaining the confidentiality of \nNSLs. \nIf a bank files a SAR after receiving a NSL, the SAR should not contain any reference to the \nreceipt or existence of the NSL.  The SAR should reference only those facts and activities \nthat support a finding of unusual or suspicious transactions identified by the bank. \nQuestions regarding NSLs should be directed to the bank’s local FBI field office.

Following the money trail will assist HSI in the \nidentification of key members of criminal organizations involved in HS/HT \nactivity, as well as the identification of assets, monies and proceeds derived \nfrom or used in support of their criminal activity; and, \n(2) Ensure the seizure of these assets, which is crucial to shutting down \nentrenched criminal activity.\nHSI has already identified a multitude of methods to hide, move and store illicit \nproceeds associated with illegal activity, including financial institutions, money \nservices businesses, bulk cash smuggling organizations, etc.  Seizing the funds that \nmotivate and amplify the problems associated with these organizations is a high \npriority for HSI and DHS.\nIssues & Guidance', 'Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n75 \n2/27/2015.V2 \n•\nControls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of the\ncompany and the depository institution.\nControlled by means that the depository institution:  \n•\nDirectly or indirectly has the power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of the voting\nsecurities of the company; or\n•\nControls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of the\ncompany. See 12 USC 1841(a)(2).\nBecause foreign branches of U.S. banks are regarded as foreign banks for the purposes of the \nBSA, they are affiliates that are not subject to a SAR regulation.  Accordingly, a U.S. bank \nthat has filed a SAR may not share the SAR, or any information that would reveal the \nexistence of the SAR, with its foreign branches. \nBanks should maintain appropriate arrangements with head offices, controlling companies, \nand affiliates to protect the confidentiality of SARs.  The bank should have policies and \nprocedures in place to protect the confidentiality of the SAR as part of their internal controls.', 'Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n61 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nor other monetary instrument or investment security; or any other payment, transfer, or \ndelivery by, through, or to a bank. \nSafe Harbor for Banks From Civil Liability for Suspicious Activity \nReporting \nFederal law (31 USC 5318(g)(3)) provides protection from civil liability for all reports of \nsuspicious transactions made to appropriate authorities, including supporting documentation, \nregardless of whether such reports are filed pursuant to the SAR instructions.  Specifically, \nthe law provides that a bank and its directors, officers, employees, and agents that make a \ndisclosure to the appropriate authorities of any possible violation of law or regulation, \nincluding a disclosure in connection with the preparation of SARs, “shall not be liable to any \nperson under any law or regulation of the United States, any constitution, law, or regulation \nof any State or political subdivision of any State, or under any contract or other legally \nenforceable agreement (including any arbitration agreement), for such disclosure or for any \nfailure to provide notice of such disclosure to the person who is the subject of such disclosure \nor any other person identified in the disclosure.” The safe harbor applies to SARs filed within \nthe required reporting thresholds as well as to SARs filed voluntarily on any activity below \nthe threshold.56 \nSystems to Identify, Research, and Report \nSuspicious Activity \nSuspicious activity monitoring and reporting are critical internal controls.  Proper monitoring \nand reporting processes are essential to ensuring that the bank has an adequate and effective \nBSA compliance program.  Appropriate policies, procedures, and processes should be in \nplace to monitor and identify unusual activity.  The sophistication of monitoring systems \nshould be dictated by the bank’s risk profile, with particular emphasis on the composition of \nhigher-risk products, services, customers, entities, and geographies.  The bank should ensure \nadequate staff is assigned to the identification, research, and reporting of suspicious \nactivities, taking into account the bank’s overall risk profile and the volume of transactions.  \nMonitoring systems typically include employee identification or referrals, transaction-based \n(manual) systems, surveillance (automated) systems, or any combination of these. \nGenerally, effective suspicious activity monitoring and reporting systems include five key \ncomponents (refer to Appendix S “Key Suspicious Activity Monitoring Components”).  The \ncomponents, listed below, are interdependent, and an effective suspicious activity monitoring \nand reporting process should include successful implementation of each component.  \nBreakdowns in any one or more of these components may adversely affect SAR reporting \nand BSA compliance.  The five key components to an effective monitoring and reporting \nsystem are: \n56 The agencies incorporated the statutory expansion of the safe harbor by cross-referencing section \n5318(g) in their SAR regulations.  The OCC and FinCEN amended their SAR regulations to make clear \nthat the safe harbor also applies to a disclosure by a bank made jointly with another financial institution for \npurposes of filing a joint SAR (see 12 CFR 21.11(l) and 31 CFR 1020.320(e)), respectively.', 'Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n71 \n2/27/2015.V2 \ndetermination is made that the transaction under review is “suspicious” within the meaning \nof the SAR regulation.71 \nWhenever possible, an expeditious review of the transaction or the account is recommended \nand can be of significant assistance to law enforcement.  In any event, the review should be \ncompleted in a reasonable period of time.  What constitutes a “reasonable period of time” \nvaries according to the facts and circumstances of the particular matter being reviewed and \nthe effectiveness of the SAR monitoring, reporting, and decision-making process of each \nbank.  The key factor is that a bank has established adequate procedures for reviewing and \nassessing facts and circumstances identified as potentially suspicious, and that those \nprocedures are documented and followed.72 \nFor situations requiring immediate attention, in addition to filing a timely SAR, a bank must \nimmediately notify, by telephone, an “appropriate law enforcement authority” and, as \nnecessary, the bank’s primary regulator.  For this initial notification, an “appropriate law \nenforcement authority” would generally be the local office of the IRS Criminal Investigation \nDivision or the FBI.  Notifying law enforcement of a suspicious activity does not relieve a \nbank of its obligation to file a SAR.73 \nSAR Quality \nBanks are required to file SARs that are complete, thorough, and timely.  Banks should \ninclude all known subject information on the SAR.  The importance of the accuracy of this \ninformation cannot be overstated.  Inaccurate information on the SAR, or an incomplete or \ndisorganized narrative, may make further analysis difficult, if not impossible.  However, \nthere may be legitimate reasons why certain information may not be provided in a SAR, such \nas when the filer does not have the information.  A thorough and complete narrative may \nmake the difference in determining whether the described conduct and its possible criminal \nnature are clearly understood by law enforcement.  Because the SAR narrative section is the \nonly area summarizing suspicious activity, the section, as stated on the SAR, is “critical.” \nThus, a failure to adequately describe the factors making a transaction or activity suspicious \nundermines the purpose of the SAR. \nTo inform and assist banks in reporting instances of suspected money laundering, terrorist \nfinancing, and fraud, FinCEN issues advisories and guidance containing examples of “red \nflags.”  In order to assist law enforcement in its efforts to target these activities, FinCEN \nrequests that banks check the appropriate box(es) in the Suspicious Activity Information \n71 Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group, “Section 5 — Issues and Guidance,” The SAR Activity Review — Trends, \nTips & Issues, Issue 10, May 2006, page 44.  For examples of when the date of initial detection occurs, refer to \nSAR Activity Review — Trends, Tips, and Issues, Issue 14, October 2008, page 38. \n72 Id. \n73 For suspicious activity related to terrorist activity, institutions may also call FinCEN’s Financial Institution’s \nterrorist hot line’s toll-free number (866) 556-3974 (seven days a week, 24 hours a day) to further facilitate the \nimmediate transmittal of relevant information to the appropriate authorities.', 'Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n73 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nRecord Retention and Supporting Documentation \nBanks must retain copies of SARs and supporting documentation for five years from the date \nof filing the SAR.  The bank can retain copies in paper or electronic format.  Additionally, \nbanks must provide all documentation supporting the filing of a SAR upon request by \nFinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or federal banking agency.  “Supporting \ndocumentation” refers to all documents or records that assisted a bank in making the \ndetermination that certain activity required a SAR filing.  No legal process is required for \ndisclosure of supporting documentation to FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or \nfederal banking agency.77 \nProhibition of SAR Disclosure \nNo bank, and no director, officer, employee, or agent of a bank that reports a suspicious \ntransaction may notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been \nreported.  A SAR and any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, are \nconfidential, except as is necessary to fulfill BSA obligations and responsibilities.  For \nexample, the existence or even the non-existence of a SAR must be kept confidential, as well \nas the information contained in the SAR to the extent that the information would reveal the \nexistence of a SAR. 78  Furthermore, FinCEN and the federal banking agencies take the \nposition that a bank’s internal controls for the filing of SARs should minimize the risks of \ndisclosure. \nA bank or its agent may reveal the existence of a SAR to fulfill responsibilities consistent \nwith the BSA, provided no person involved in a suspicious transaction is notified that the \ntransaction has been reported.  The underlying facts, transactions, and supporting documents \nof a SAR may be disclosed to another financial institution for the preparation of a joint SAR, \nor in connection with certain employment references or termination notices to the full extent \nauthorized in 31 USC 5318(g)(2)(B).  The sharing of a SAR by a bank or its agent with \ncertain permissible entities within the bank’s corporate organizational structure for purposes \nconsistent with Title II of the Bank Secrecy Act is also allowed. \nAny person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR or the information \ncontained in a SAR, except when such disclosure is requested by FinCEN or an appropriate \nlaw enforcement79 or federal banking agency, shall decline to produce the SAR or to provide \n77 Refer to Suspicious Activity Report Supporting Documentation, June 13, 2007. \n78 FinCEN and the OCC issued final rules amending the confidentiality provisions of suspicious activity reports. \nThe rules clarify how, when, and to whom SAR information, and the existence of a SAR may be disclosed. \nRefer to 75 Fed. Reg. 75576 (December 3, 2010) (OCC) and 75 Fed. Reg. R 75593 (December 3, 2010) \n(FinCEN). \n79 Examples of agencies to which a SAR or the information contained therein could be provided include: the \ncriminal investigative services of the armed forces; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; an attorney \ngeneral, district attorney, or state’s attorney at the state or local level; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal Revenue Service or tax enforcement agencies at the state level; the \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control; a state or local police department; a United States Attorney’s Office; \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; and the U.S. Secret Service.

Recording Information: Complete each FinCEN SAR by providing as much information as \npossible. Although all items should be completed fully and accurately, items marked with an \nasterisk (*) must be completed even when the required data are unknown.  Filers must follow \nthe electronic filing instructions for these items by providing the required data or, if instructions \npermit, by checking the box “Unknown” to indicate that the required data was unknown. Items \nthat do not begin with an asterisk must be completed if the data are known and will be left \nblank if the data are unknown. If an item’s instructions differ from this general instruction, the \nitem instructions must be followed. These instructions supersede all prior SAR instructions and \nFinCEN guidance on use of special responses in SAR items when the data are unknown or not \navailable in an electronic filing. Therefore, the use of special responses such as “UNKNOWN,” \n“NONE,” “NOT APPLICABLE,” or “XX” and their variants is prohibited in the FinCEN SAR.  \n \nNOTE:  Throughout these instructions the phrase “check box” and similar wording is used to \ndenote checking an appropriate box in certain data items on the discrete FinCEN SAR. This is \ndeemed equivalent to instructions in the Electronic Filing Requirements to enter appropriate \ncodes in the same data items in transmission files. For example, the requirement to check box 1 \n“Initial report” in the discrete FinCEN SAR is the equivalent of entering code “A” in “Type of \nFiling” in the Electronic Filing Requirements Suspicious Activity Information (3A) Record. In \nsome discrete FinCEN SAR data items check boxes have been replaced by drop-down lists.  \n \nNOTE:  Throughout these instructions there are requirements to complete items multiple times \nin a discrete FinCEN SAR if the filer has multiple entries for that item. This is deemed \nequivalent to completing multiple records for that item in the Electronic Filing Requirements. \nFor example, these instructions direct filers to complete multiple Item 6 “Alternate name” fields \nif the filer has knowledge of multiple alternate names for a subject. This is equivalent to a batch \nfiler completing multiple Subject Alternative Name (4D) Records for the same subject.  \n \n3. Corrected/Amended Reports:  A corrected report on a previously-filed FinCEN SAR or prior \nSAR versions must be filed whenever errors are discovered in the data reported in that FinCEN \nSAR. An amended report must be filed on a previously-filed FinCEN SAR or prior SAR \nversions whenever new data about a reported suspicious activity is discovered and \ncircumstances will not justify filing a continuing report (see General Instruction 4). Both \ncorrected and amended reports must be completed in their entirety, with the necessary \ncorrections or amendments made to the data. In both cases box 1b “Correct/Amend prior \nreport” must be checked. If known, the prior report’s Document Control Number (DCN) or BSA \nIdentifier (BSA ID) must be entered in field 1e.

For example, there would be multiple 2C records for activity \noccurring at multiple branch locations, multiple 4A records to accommodate \nmore than one suspect, and multiple 2B records if more than one financial \ninstitution was involved.', '34\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\nSAR Activity Review — Trends, Tips & Issues (Issue 22)\n\t\nFor example, if a financial institution needs to file a FinCEN SAR on kiting, they \nwould check the “Other” box in Item 31 (Fraud) and type the word “Kiting” in \nthe associated text field.  For kiting associated with the use of checks, a financial \ninstitution also would select the “Check” box in Item 31 (Fraud).\n \nInquiries related to Step 5 (Narrative)\n•\t What is required when describing the suspicious activity identified?  The \nnarrative is critical to understanding the suspicious activity being reported.  \nHow the narrative is written may determine whether the suspicious activity \nis clearly understood by investigators.  Filers must complete the narrative in \nEnglish and provide a clear, complete, and concise description of the suspicious \nactivity.  This narrative should include the data provided in the FinCEN SAR \nand any other information necessary to explain the suspicious activity.

Other sections of the FinCEN \nSAR have been expanded to allow for filers to provide additional information \nin those parts of the report, such as additional check boxes to characterize the \nsuspicious activity being reported.  Even though, as noted, the narrative remains \na critical part of the FinCEN SAR, filers should consider the reduced size of the \nnarrative section, and the expanded fields in other parts of the form, and utilize \nthe narrative in such a manner as to maximize the value of the information being \nprovided in that section.\nWhen writing a narrative, filers should aim to expand upon the information \nprovided in the other parts of the FinCEN SAR and provide any additional \ninformation needed to address five essential elements of information – who? what? \nwhen? where? and why? – about the suspicious activity being reported:   \nWho is conducting the suspicious activity?\nPart I of the SAR instructs the filer to provide specific information about the \nsubject(s) of the filing.  In the SAR narrative, the filer can further describe the \nsuspect(s), such as occupational information, including position or title, and the \nnature of the suspect’s business.  The SAR narrative should also include any \nknown relationships among subjects reported on the SAR or businesses identified \nin the narrative.  While detailed subject information may not always be available \n(i.e., situations involving non-account holders), filers should include as much \ninformation as is known to them about the subject(s).   \nWhat instruments, methods or mechanisms are being used to \nfacilitate the suspect transaction(s)?\nAn effective SAR narrative describes how the subject(s) conducted the illicit activity, \nincluding what instruments, methods or mechanisms were used.  For example, \nwhether shell companies were suspected as being either the sender or beneficiary \nof a wire transfer, or whether the subject(s) used the Internet or Remote Deposit \nCapture to initiate the activity.', 'Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \nElectronic Filing Requirements for the FinCEN Suspicious Activity Report (FinCEN SAR) \n93 \nItem 19 E-mail address: Enter the subject\'s e-mail address if known.

That is why the question must \nbe asked:  “Who is the person that has ‘obtained’ the prepaid access when the \nproduct is a Business Funded Card?”  Using a risk-based approach, collecting and \nverifying the cardholder’s personal information on a blanket basis many not be \nappropriate for all cardholders with Business Funded Cards – especially when the \nbusiness-funded cards cannot be reloaded or do not access cash.  In this regard, it \nshould be noted that in a traditional bank account opened for a business, the bank’s \nCIP obligation clearly relates to the business and not to the business’ individual \ncustomers or employees who may receive checks from that business.25  Moreover, in \nmost instances, the risk of abuse of Business Funded Cards for money laundering \nand terrorist financing purposes lies predominantly with the business that is \nfunding the cards, not the individual who may ultimately spend those funds.  If \na provider’s AML program is to be “appropriate” for its operations, then it is \ncertainly crucial that identification/verification should be performed on the business \nobtaining the prepaid access.  \nWhat Are Some Recommendations for Banks, Provides and Sellers \ninvolved with Business Funded Card programs?\nBusiness Funded Cards do pose some risks and best practices dictate that certain \nprocedures should be followed by banks, providers and sellers that wish to issue, \npromote and distribute Business Funded Card products.

"How do financial and behavioral indicators of trafficking help identify human trafficking activities in vulnerable communities, and what role do federal agencies play in addressing goods produced by forced or child labor?","Financial and behavioral indicators of trafficking play a crucial role in identifying human trafficking activities, particularly in vulnerable communities. These indicators help financial institutions and law enforcement agencies detect suspicious activities that may be linked to human trafficking. Federal agencies, in turn, play a significant role in addressing goods produced by forced or child labor. Here's a comprehensive analysis based on the provided regulatory documents:

### Financial and Behavioral Indicators of Trafficking

1. **Behavioral Indicators:**
   - Victims often have limited contact with the outside world, primarily interacting with traffickers. Their only external interactions may occur at financial institutions.
   - Customer-facing staff at financial institutions are trained to recognize behavioral indicators such as a third party speaking on behalf of a customer, maintaining control over documents, or showing signs of physical abuse or poor living conditions.
   - These indicators are crucial for filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), which are used by law enforcement to investigate potential trafficking activities.

2. **Financial Indicators:**
   - Traffickers use various financial methods to launder money, including funnel accounts, front companies, and alternative payment methods like prepaid cards and cryptocurrencies.
   - Financial institutions are advised to look for red flags such as inconsistent transaction patterns, frequent cash deposits without corresponding Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments, and transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions.
   - The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provides guidance on recognizing these financial red flags, which are indicative of money laundering and human trafficking.

3. **Typologies and Evolving Techniques:**
   - Traffickers employ evolving techniques to evade detection, such as using front companies in legitimate industries (e.g., massage parlors, restaurants) to mask illicit activities.
   - They also exploit employment practices, such as visa fraud and wage retention, to profit from labor trafficking.

### Role of Federal Agencies

1. **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP):**
   - CBP issues Withhold Release Orders (WROs) against imported goods suspected of being produced with forced or child labor. This prevents such goods from entering the U.S. market.

2. **U.S. Department of Labor:**
   - Maintains a list of goods and source countries believed to be produced by forced or child labor, helping to enforce international labor standards.

3. **Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN):**
   - FinCEN collaborates with law enforcement to identify financial and behavioral indicators of trafficking, providing advisories to financial institutions to enhance detection and reporting of suspicious activities.

4. **U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):**
   - Through initiatives like Project STAMP, ICE targets the financial assets of human trafficking organizations, aiming to dismantle their operations by seizing illicit proceeds.

5. **INTERPOL:**
   - Conducts operations like STORM MAKERS to identify and dismantle human trafficking networks, particularly those involved in forced online fraud.

### Conclusion

Financial and behavioral indicators are essential tools for identifying human trafficking activities, especially in vulnerable communities. These indicators enable financial institutions to detect and report suspicious activities, aiding law enforcement in their investigations. Federal agencies play a critical role in addressing goods produced by forced or child labor through regulatory measures and international collaboration. By targeting the financial infrastructure of trafficking networks, these agencies aim to disrupt and dismantle criminal operations, thereby protecting vulnerable populations and upholding human rights.","['Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives,” (January 30, 2018); and Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 55-56, (July 2018). 27.

This \nadvisory provides: (i) new information to assist in identifying and reporting human trafficking, and \nto aid the global effort to combat this crime; and (ii) two illustrative recent case studies.

The only outside contact they may have is when visiting financial institutions such as \nbank branches, check cashing counters, or money wiring services.  Consequently, it is important that \ncustomer-facing staff consider the following behavioral indicators when conducting transactions,28 \nparticularly those that also present financial indicators of human trafficking schemes discussed \nbelow.  As appropriate, such information should be incorporated into Suspicious Activity Report \n(SAR) filings and/or reported to law enforcement.29  When incorporated into SAR filings, it is \nimportant that behavioral indicators, and the staff who witnessed them, are included in the SAR \nnarrative so that information may be effectively searched for, and later used by, law enforcement.  \nThis list is not exhaustive and is only a selection of behavioral indicators:30\n\tA third party speaks on behalf of the customer (a third party may insist on being present and/\nor translating).\n\tA third party insists on being present for every aspect of the transaction.  \n\tA third party attempts to fill out paperwork without consulting the customer.\n\tA third party maintains possession and/or control of all documents or money.\n\tA third party claims to be related to the customer, but does not know critical details.\n\tA prospective customer uses, or attempts to use, third-party identification (of someone who is \nnot present) to open an account.  \n\tA third party attempts to open an account for an unqualified minor.\n\tA third party commits acts of physical aggression or intimidation toward the customer.  \n\tA customer shows signs of poor hygiene, malnourishment, fatigue, signs of physical and/or \nsexual abuse, physical restraint, confinement, or torture.\n\tA customer shows lack of knowledge of their whereabouts, cannot clarify where they live or \nwhere they are staying, or provides scripted, confusing, or inconsistent stories in response to \ninquiry.\n28.\t Additional resources discussing human trafficking and the role of financial institutions include the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security, Blue Campaign, “Resources Page”; U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Combatting Human \nTrafficking,” (January, 29, 2020); U.S. Department of State, “Tracking Suspicious Financial Activity to Address Human \nTrafficking,” (June 28, 2018); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to \nCombat Human Trafficking,” (January 29, 2015); and Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human \nTrafficking,” (July 2018).  \n29.\t To report suspicious activity indicative of human trafficking to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line, call 1-866-DHS-2-ICE (1-866-347-2423) 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek, every day of the year.

Human \ntraffickers can exploit individuals within the border of a country, and even in a victim’s own \nhome.  Human trafficking can also begin as human smuggling, as individuals who enter a \ncountry voluntarily and illegally are inherently vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and often \nowe a large debt to their smuggler.10\nBecause the information financial institutions collect and report is vital to identifying human \ntrafficking and stopping the growth of this crime, it is imperative that financial institutions \nenable their detection and reporting of suspicious transactions by becoming aware of the current \nmethodologies that traffickers and facilitators use.  It is also critical that customer-facing staff are \naware of behavioral indicators that may indicate human trafficking, as the only outside contact for \nvictims of human trafficking may occur when visiting financial institutions.\n10.\t See U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, “Human Trafficking vs Human Smuggling,” (Summer 2017); and \nsee also U.S. Department of State, “Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling: Understanding the Difference,” (June \n27, 2017).\n11.\t An establishment that provides food, drinks, dancing, and music, and is typically found in Latin American \ncommunities.   \n12.\t See Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 54 (July 2018).

New Typologies of Human Trafficking \nTo evade detection, hide their illicit proceeds, and profit off the backs of victims, human traffickers \nemploy a variety of evolving techniques.  Below are four typologies, identified in Bank Secrecy Act \n(BSA) data since FinCEN issued the 2014 Advisory, that human traffickers and facilitators have \nused to launder money.  \n1.  Front Companies \nHuman traffickers routinely establish and use front companies, sometimes legal entities, to hide \nthe true nature of a business, and its illicit activities, owners, and associates.  Front companies are \nbusinesses that combine illicit proceeds with those gained from legitimate business operations.  \nExamples of front companies used by human traffickers for labor or sex trafficking include massage \nbusinesses, escort services, bars, restaurants, and cantinas.11  In the case of businesses that act as \na front for human trafficking, typically the establishment appears legitimate with registrations \nand licenses.  The front company generates revenue from sales of alcoholic beverages and cover \ncharges.  Patrons, however, also can obtain illicit sexual services from trafficked individuals, \nusually elsewhere in the establishment.12  In addition, illicit massage businesses or nail and hair \nsalons can offer sexual services under the guise of legitimate businesses and/or exploit individuals \nfor the purpose of forced labor.13  Often, these establishments will appear to be a single storefront, \nyet are part of a larger network.  Payments for these illicit services are usually in cash, and \ntraffickers may invest the illicit proceeds in high-value assets, such as real estate and cars.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n5\nCase Study: Funnel Accounts Facilitate International Thai Sex Trafficking Ring\n4.  Alternative Payment Methods \nIn addition to payment via cash, traffickers also have accepted payment via credit cards, prepaid \ncards,23 mobile payment applications, and convertible virtual currency.24  Buyers of commercial \nsex use prepaid cards—a method of payment using funds paid in advance, which can be acquired \nanonymously with cash or on darknet websites—to register with escort websites and to purchase \nsexual services, flights, throw-away phones, and hotel rooms.25\nIllicit actors also use virtual currency to advertise commercial sex online.  For example, human \ntraffickers have purchased prepaid cards, and then used the cards to purchase virtual currency on \na peer-to-peer exchange platform.  Human traffickers then use the virtual currency to buy online \nadvertisements that feature commercial sex acts to obtain customers.26\nFinCEN also has identified transactions in which human traffickers use third-party payment \nprocessors (TPPPs) to wire funds, which gives the appearance that the TPPP is the originator or \nbeneficiary of the wire transfer and conceals the true originator or beneficiary.  For example, human \ntraffickers facilitate payments via TPPPs for the operation of online escort services and online \nstreaming services that use voice-over Internet protocol technology.  Human traffickers and their \nfacilitators use TPPPs to wire funds to individuals or businesses both domestically and abroad.27\nCase Study: Trafficking Involving Prepaid Cards and Bitcoin\nII.  Behavioral and Financial Red Flag Indicators \nof Human Trafficking\nIn applying the red flags below and the red flags in the 2014 Advisory, financial institutions are \nadvised that no single red flag is a clear indicator of human trafficking activity, although each can \nbe indicative of forced labor and/or sex trafficking.  Given that human trafficking is a predicate \noffense to money laundering, the financial red flags also may be indicative of other money \nlaundering-related offenses.  Financial institutions should consider additional factors, such as \na customer’s previous financial activity and the existence of typologies or other red flags, when \ndetermining whether transactions may be associated with human trafficking.  \n23.\t See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “National Money Laundering Risk Assessment,” p. 15-16, (2018).\n24.\t For more information about illicit activity involving convertible virtual currency see FinCEN Advisory, \nFIN-2019-A003, “Advisory on Illicit Activity Involving Convertible Virtual Currency,” (May 9, 2019).\n25.\t See New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s testimony, “Following the Money: How Human Traffickers \nExploit the U.S. Financial Markets: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the \nCommittee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives,” (January 30, 2018).

These red flags do not replace the red flags \nidentified in the 2014 Advisory, all of which remain relevant.31  The Financial Action Task Force \nreport on the “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking” also provides numerous indicators of \nmoney laundering related to human trafficking.32\n\tCustomers frequently appear to move through, and transact from, different geographic \nlocations in the United States.  These transactions can be combined with travel and \ntransactions in and to foreign countries that are significant conduits for human trafficking.33\n\tTransactions are inconsistent with a customer’s expected activity and/or line of business in \nan apparent effort to cover trafficking victims’ living costs, including housing (e.g., hotel, \nmotel, short-term rentals, or residential accommodations), transportation (e.g., airplane, taxi, \nlimousine, or rideshare services), medical expenses, pharmacies, clothing, grocery stores, and \nrestaurants, to include fast food eateries.   \n\tTransactional activity largely occurs outside of normal business operating hours (e.g., an \nestablishment that operates during the day has a large number of transactions at night), is \nalmost always made in cash, and deposits are larger than what is expected for the business \nand the size of its operations.  \n\tA customer frequently makes cash deposits with no Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments. \n\tAn individual frequently purchases and uses prepaid access cards.  \n\tA customer’s account shares common identifiers, such as a telephone number, email, and \nsocial media handle, or address, associated with escort agency websites and commercial sex \nadvertisements.\n\tFrequent transactions with online classified sites that are based in foreign jurisdictions.  \n\tA customer frequently sends or receives funds via cryptocurrency to or from darknet markets \nor services known to be associated with illicit activity.  This may include services that host \nadvertising content for illicit services, sell illicit content, or financial institutions that allow \nprepaid cards to pay for cryptocurrencies without appropriate risk mitigation controls.\n\tFrequent transactions using third-party payment processors that conceal the originators and/\nor beneficiaries of the transactions.  \n\tA customer avoids transactions that require identification documents or that trigger reporting \nrequirements.\n31.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A008, “Guidance on Recognizing Activity that May be Associated with Human \nSmuggling and Human Trafficking – Financial Red Flags,” (September 11, 2014).\n32.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” pp. 65-70, (July 2018).\n33.\t For information on specific countries, and whether they are conduits for human trafficking, see U.S. Department of \nState, “Trafficking in Persons Report,” (June 2019).', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n4\n2.  Exploitative Employment Practices \nSome seemingly legitimate businesses use exploitative employment schemes, such as visa fraud and \nwage retention, to amass profit from labor and sex trafficking.  For instance, some labor recruiters \nmislead or defraud victims, taking advantage of workers before and after they enter the United States.  \nSome labor recruiters also mislead workers about the conditions and nature of a job, engage in contract \nswitching, and confiscate or destroy workers’ identity documents.14  Foreign nationals who have \nlegitimate temporary work or student visas also can be exploited.15\nAnother common practice is to charge exploitative fees to workers by withholding their salary \nor paying less than promised.  The trafficker claims that the fees cover the costs of recruitment \nor access to job opportunities.16  Recruitment fees can range from hundreds of dollars to tens of \nthousands of dollars, and take years to repay.17  Victims’ salaries are transferred to the traffickers \nor their co-conspirators via teller checks or wire transfers.  Proceeds also can be “disguised” as a \nlegitimate business expense, such as a cleaning service.  Financial institutions may see multiple \nemployees receiving their salaries in the same account, or payment for employment may be \nfollowed by immediate withdrawal or transfer into another account.18\n3.  Funnel Accounts \nFunnel accounts generally involve an individual or business account in one geographic area \nthat receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, from \nwhich the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between \nthe deposits and withdrawals.19  Human traffickers may use interstate funnel accounts to transfer \nfunds between geographic areas, move proceeds rapidly, and maintain anonymity.20  In labor and \nsex trafficking schemes, human traffickers may open accounts in their name, or escort victims to \na bank, and force them to open an account.21  Traffickers maintain control of the victims’ bank \naccounts through coercion, and direct victims to deposit money into their accounts and other \naccounts that the traffickers can access.22  In some cases, victims also are coerced or forced to wire \nproceeds via money services businesses (MSBs) to facilitate the funneling of proceeds.   \n14.\t U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017); see also U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, “Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February \n25, 2016).\n15.\t U.S. Department of Justice, Journal of Federal Law and Practice, “Human Trafficking,” Executive Office of United \nStates Attorneys, pp. 5 and 28, (November 2017).\n16.\t For more information see U.S. Department of Justice, “Leader of Human Trafficking Organization Sentenced to Over \n15 Years for Exploiting Guatemalan Migrants at Ohio Egg Farms,” (June 27, 2016); and U.S. Department of Justice, \n“Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February 25, 2016).  \n17.\t See U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017).\n18.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 28, (July 2018).\n19.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A005, “Update on U.S. Currency Restrictions in Mexico: Funnel Accounts and TBML,” \np. 1, (May 28, 2014).  \n20.\t See U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking,” \n(January 29, 2015).\n21.\t For additional behavioral indicators of human trafficking, see Section II, infra.\n22.\t Policies of certain large national banks to restrict third-party cash deposits for private customer accounts seem to have \nlessened the use of funnel account activity.', '1\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \n(FinCEN) is issuing this advisory to help save lives, \nand to protect the most vulnerable in our society \nfrom predators and cowards who prey on the \ninnocent and defenseless for money and greed.

In 2023, Operation STORM MAKERS \nII, which was aimed at identifying and \ndismantling criminal organizations engaged \nin human trafficking and smuggling of \nmigrants, entailed a unique focus on the \ntrend of human trafficking for the purpose \nof online fraud in Southeast Asia and other \nimpacted regions.\n7  INTERPOL.

Online scams and Human Trafficking in South East Asia / Update 2 – From Regional to Global Threat (PUBLIC Version). 06 July 2023. INTERPOL \nfor official use only.\nFinancial Fraud and Forced Criminality\nINTERPOL research and analysis brought to \nlight a trend involving human trafficking for the \npurpose of forced online fraud. This trend refers \nto a modus operandi involving, on the one hand, \nVictims (A) - those who are trafficked and forced to \nconduct online fraud in so-called scam call centres \nor compounds and, on the other hand, Victims \n(B) - those who are defrauded of large sums of \nmoney by the trafficked victims. In the framework \nof Operation STORM MAKERS I & II, INTERPOL’s \nHuman Trafficking and Smuggling of Migrants \n(HTSM) Unit identified large-scale, cyber-enabled \nhuman trafficking operations perpetrated by Asian \ncrime syndicates for the purpose of forced online \nfraud across several Southeast Asian countries7. \nWhilst originally, trafficked individuals were mostly \nChinese-speaking victims, as the trend spread, \nboth recruitment and defrauding strategies further \nevolved to include victims from across the world8. \nAlthough it is important to note that not all scam \ncentres depend on the use of forced criminality, \ninformation recently shared by member countries \nwith INTERPOL suggests that scam centres or \ncompounds that do exploit trafficked victims have \nbegun to emerge across the globe. In Latin America, \nINTERPOL member countries have reported the \nidentification of a similar modus operandi where \nVictims (A), who typically originate from the region, \nare recruited through fake job advertisements, \nsometimes in public spaces. Once in the compounds, \ntheir identity documents are taken and they are \nforced to commit online financial fraud, mostly in \nthe form of advance-payment fraud, telecom fraud \nand impersonation fraud. These schemes tend to \ninvolve relatively small sums of money (between \nUSD 100 and USD 500), but they are replicated on \na large-scale through social media platforms and \nonline marketplaces. The fact that small sums are \ninvolved often discourages victims from reporting \nthe fraud, which prevents the identification of the \ncriminal structures behind these fraud schemes.\nFurthermore, INTERPOL has been notified of the \nexistence of similar scam centres in African countries, \ntargeting not only individuals and businesses in the \nAfrican region, but also worldwide. \nRegarding Europe, and based on cases shared with \nINTERPOL, scam centres were reportedly active \nsince the 2010s in European countries among \nother member countries. Moreover, and although \nintelligence gaps remain, there are reports pointing \nat the existence of human trafficking-fuelled scam \ncentres in Eastern European countries, where local \ngroups are believed to be collaborating with foreign \ncriminal organizations. In these cases, Victims (A) \nare reportedly from the Middle East.  \nAs this modus operandi continues to expand and \nthe profiles of Victims (A) become more diversified, \nwith victims from Asia, Africa and Latin America \nbeing held in scam centres, it is highly likely that the \npool of targeted Victims (B) will further enlarge. In \naddition, the emergence of AI-generated content \nwill likely increase the reach, sophistication and \ncapacity of fraud schemes conducted through \ntrafficking-driven scam centres, resulting in the \nexpansion of fraud worldwide.\n12', 'Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n317 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nestablished using bearer shares; ownership records are not maintained, rather ownership is \nbased on physical possession of the stock certificates.

Additionally, federal agencies such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Labor play a significant role by issuing Withhold and Release Orders against imported goods suspected of being produced by forced or child labor and maintaining lists of such goods and their source countries, thereby addressing the importation of products linked to trafficking.","['<1-hop>\n\nF I N C E N A D V I S O R Y 2 traffickers target those most impacted and vulnerable.4 Other effects of the pandemic (e.g., travel limitations, shelter-in-place orders, teleworking) also may affect the typologies and red flag indicators provided below. Unfortunately, in addition to the horrific toll on victims and their families, their very lives, dignity, and livelihood, human trafficking is now one of the most profitable and violent forms of international crime, generating an estimated $150 billion worldwide per year.5 In the United States, human trafficking now occurs in a broad range of licit and illicit industries (e.g., hospitality, agricultural, janitorial services, construction, restaurants, care for persons with disabilities, salon services, massage parlors, retail, fairs and carnivals, peddling and begging, child care, domestic work, and drug smuggling and distribution).6 Transactions involving proceeds generated by human trafficking can be the basis for federal criminal charges and asset forfeiture, as human trafficking and associated crimes constitute specified unlawful activities (SUAs) for the crime of money laundering.7 Since the 2014 Advisory, FinCEN collaborated with law enforcement to identify 20 new financial and behavioral indicators of labor and sex trafficking, and four additional typologies.

"how traffickers target vulnerable communities and what financial and behavioral indicators of trafficking is there, and how this relate to goods produced by forced or child labor being imported in US?","Human traffickers target vulnerable communities by exploiting their socio-economic conditions, lack of support structures, and limited access to resources. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these vulnerabilities, as support systems for potential victims have collapsed, making them more susceptible to traffickers. Traffickers often target individuals in communities with high levels of poverty, unemployment, and social instability. They use deceptive recruitment practices, such as false job advertisements, to lure victims into exploitative situations. Once recruited, victims may be subjected to forced labor or commercial sex acts through coercion, fraud, or physical force.

Financial and behavioral indicators of trafficking include:

1. **Financial Indicators:**
   - Use of front companies to launder money, often in industries like hospitality, agriculture, and massage parlors.
   - Exploitative employment practices, such as visa fraud and wage retention, to control victims.
   - Use of funnel accounts to move money across geographic locations, often involving cash deposits below reporting thresholds.
   - Use of alternative payment methods, such as prepaid cards and cryptocurrencies, to conceal transactions.
   - Frequent cash deposits without corresponding Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments.
   - Transactions inconsistent with a customer's expected activity, often covering victims' living costs.
   - Use of third-party payment processors to obscure transaction origins.

2. **Behavioral Indicators:**
   - A third party speaking or acting on behalf of the customer, often controlling documents and money.
   - Customers showing signs of physical abuse, poor hygiene, or lack of knowledge about their whereabouts.
   - Customers providing scripted or inconsistent stories.

These indicators are crucial for financial institutions to identify and report suspicious activities related to human trafficking. Financial institutions play a vital role in detecting trafficking by monitoring transactions and reporting suspicious activities through Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).

The relationship between trafficking and goods produced by forced or child labor being imported into the U.S. is significant. Goods produced under such conditions can be illegally imported into the U.S., and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issues Withhold and Release Orders against merchandise suspected of being produced by forced or child labor. This regulatory framework aims to prevent the importation of goods that violate international labor standards and to disrupt the financial incentives for trafficking.

Overall, combating human trafficking requires a multi-faceted approach involving regulatory measures, financial monitoring, and international cooperation to address both the exploitation of individuals and the illegal importation of goods produced under exploitative conditions.","['crime; and (ii) two illustrative recent case studies.

New Typologies of Human Trafficking \nTo evade detection, hide their illicit proceeds, and profit off the backs of victims, human traffickers \nemploy a variety of evolving techniques.  Below are four typologies, identified in Bank Secrecy Act \n(BSA) data since FinCEN issued the 2014 Advisory, that human traffickers and facilitators have \nused to launder money.  \n1.  Front Companies \nHuman traffickers routinely establish and use front companies, sometimes legal entities, to hide \nthe true nature of a business, and its illicit activities, owners, and associates.  Front companies are \nbusinesses that combine illicit proceeds with those gained from legitimate business operations.  \nExamples of front companies used by human traffickers for labor or sex trafficking include massage \nbusinesses, escort services, bars, restaurants, and cantinas.11  In the case of businesses that act as \na front for human trafficking, typically the establishment appears legitimate with registrations \nand licenses.  The front company generates revenue from sales of alcoholic beverages and cover \ncharges.  Patrons, however, also can obtain illicit sexual services from trafficked individuals, \nusually elsewhere in the establishment.12  In addition, illicit massage businesses or nail and hair \nsalons can offer sexual services under the guise of legitimate businesses and/or exploit individuals \nfor the purpose of forced labor.13  Often, these establishments will appear to be a single storefront, \nyet are part of a larger network.  Payments for these illicit services are usually in cash, and \ntraffickers may invest the illicit proceeds in high-value assets, such as real estate and cars.', '1\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \n(FinCEN) is issuing this advisory to help save lives, \nand to protect the most vulnerable in our society \nfrom predators and cowards who prey on the \ninnocent and defenseless for money and greed.

Exploitative Employment Practices \nSome seemingly legitimate businesses use exploitative employment schemes, such as visa fraud and \nwage retention, to amass profit from labor and sex trafficking.  For instance, some labor recruiters \nmislead or defraud victims, taking advantage of workers before and after they enter the United States.  \nSome labor recruiters also mislead workers about the conditions and nature of a job, engage in contract \nswitching, and confiscate or destroy workers’ identity documents.14  Foreign nationals who have \nlegitimate temporary work or student visas also can be exploited.15\nAnother common practice is to charge exploitative fees to workers by withholding their salary \nor paying less than promised.  The trafficker claims that the fees cover the costs of recruitment \nor access to job opportunities.16  Recruitment fees can range from hundreds of dollars to tens of \nthousands of dollars, and take years to repay.17  Victims’ salaries are transferred to the traffickers \nor their co-conspirators via teller checks or wire transfers.  Proceeds also can be “disguised” as a \nlegitimate business expense, such as a cleaning service.  Financial institutions may see multiple \nemployees receiving their salaries in the same account, or payment for employment may be \nfollowed by immediate withdrawal or transfer into another account.18\n3.  Funnel Accounts \nFunnel accounts generally involve an individual or business account in one geographic area \nthat receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, from \nwhich the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between \nthe deposits and withdrawals.19  Human traffickers may use interstate funnel accounts to transfer \nfunds between geographic areas, move proceeds rapidly, and maintain anonymity.20  In labor and \nsex trafficking schemes, human traffickers may open accounts in their name, or escort victims to \na bank, and force them to open an account.21  Traffickers maintain control of the victims’ bank \naccounts through coercion, and direct victims to deposit money into their accounts and other \naccounts that the traffickers can access.22  In some cases, victims also are coerced or forced to wire \nproceeds via money services businesses (MSBs) to facilitate the funneling of proceeds.   \n14.\t U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017); see also U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, “Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February \n25, 2016).\n15.\t U.S. Department of Justice, Journal of Federal Law and Practice, “Human Trafficking,” Executive Office of United \nStates Attorneys, pp. 5 and 28, (November 2017).\n16.\t For more information see U.S. Department of Justice, “Leader of Human Trafficking Organization Sentenced to Over \n15 Years for Exploiting Guatemalan Migrants at Ohio Egg Farms,” (June 27, 2016); and U.S. Department of Justice, \n“Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February 25, 2016).  \n17.\t See U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017).\n18.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 28, (July 2018).\n19.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A005, “Update on U.S. Currency Restrictions in Mexico: Funnel Accounts and TBML,” \np. 1, (May 28, 2014).  \n20.\t See U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking,” \n(January 29, 2015).\n21.\t For additional behavioral indicators of human trafficking, see Section II, infra.\n22.\t Policies of certain large national banks to restrict third-party cash deposits for private customer accounts seem to have \nlessened the use of funnel account activity.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n6\nBehavioral Indicators \nMany victims of human trafficking do not have regular contact with anyone other than their \ntraffickers.  The only outside contact they may have is when visiting financial institutions such as \nbank branches, check cashing counters, or money wiring services.  Consequently, it is important that \ncustomer-facing staff consider the following behavioral indicators when conducting transactions,28 \nparticularly those that also present financial indicators of human trafficking schemes discussed \nbelow.  As appropriate, such information should be incorporated into Suspicious Activity Report \n(SAR) filings and/or reported to law enforcement.29  When incorporated into SAR filings, it is \nimportant that behavioral indicators, and the staff who witnessed them, are included in the SAR \nnarrative so that information may be effectively searched for, and later used by, law enforcement.  \nThis list is not exhaustive and is only a selection of behavioral indicators:30\n\tA third party speaks on behalf of the customer (a third party may insist on being present and/\nor translating).\n\tA third party insists on being present for every aspect of the transaction.  \n\tA third party attempts to fill out paperwork without consulting the customer.\n\tA third party maintains possession and/or control of all documents or money.\n\tA third party claims to be related to the customer, but does not know critical details.\n\tA prospective customer uses, or attempts to use, third-party identification (of someone who is \nnot present) to open an account.  \n\tA third party attempts to open an account for an unqualified minor.\n\tA third party commits acts of physical aggression or intimidation toward the customer.  \n\tA customer shows signs of poor hygiene, malnourishment, fatigue, signs of physical and/or \nsexual abuse, physical restraint, confinement, or torture.\n\tA customer shows lack of knowledge of their whereabouts, cannot clarify where they live or \nwhere they are staying, or provides scripted, confusing, or inconsistent stories in response to \ninquiry.\n28.\t Additional resources discussing human trafficking and the role of financial institutions include the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security, Blue Campaign, “Resources Page”; U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Combatting Human \nTrafficking,” (January, 29, 2020); U.S. Department of State, “Tracking Suspicious Financial Activity to Address Human \nTrafficking,” (June 28, 2018); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to \nCombat Human Trafficking,” (January 29, 2015); and Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human \nTrafficking,” (July 2018).  \n29.\t To report suspicious activity indicative of human trafficking to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line, call 1-866-DHS-2-ICE (1-866-347-2423) 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek, every day of the year.

Alternative Payment Methods \nIn addition to payment via cash, traffickers also have accepted payment via credit cards, prepaid \ncards,23 mobile payment applications, and convertible virtual currency.24  Buyers of commercial \nsex use prepaid cards—a method of payment using funds paid in advance, which can be acquired \nanonymously with cash or on darknet websites—to register with escort websites and to purchase \nsexual services, flights, throw-away phones, and hotel rooms.25\nIllicit actors also use virtual currency to advertise commercial sex online.  For example, human \ntraffickers have purchased prepaid cards, and then used the cards to purchase virtual currency on \na peer-to-peer exchange platform.  Human traffickers then use the virtual currency to buy online \nadvertisements that feature commercial sex acts to obtain customers.26\nFinCEN also has identified transactions in which human traffickers use third-party payment \nprocessors (TPPPs) to wire funds, which gives the appearance that the TPPP is the originator or \nbeneficiary of the wire transfer and conceals the true originator or beneficiary.  For example, human \ntraffickers facilitate payments via TPPPs for the operation of online escort services and online \nstreaming services that use voice-over Internet protocol technology.  Human traffickers and their \nfacilitators use TPPPs to wire funds to individuals or businesses both domestically and abroad.27\nCase Study: Trafficking Involving Prepaid Cards and Bitcoin\nII.  Behavioral and Financial Red Flag Indicators \nof Human Trafficking\nIn applying the red flags below and the red flags in the 2014 Advisory, financial institutions are \nadvised that no single red flag is a clear indicator of human trafficking activity, although each can \nbe indicative of forced labor and/or sex trafficking.  Given that human trafficking is a predicate \noffense to money laundering, the financial red flags also may be indicative of other money \nlaundering-related offenses.  Financial institutions should consider additional factors, such as \na customer’s previous financial activity and the existence of typologies or other red flags, when \ndetermining whether transactions may be associated with human trafficking.  \n23.\t See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “National Money Laundering Risk Assessment,” p. 15-16, (2018).\n24.\t For more information about illicit activity involving convertible virtual currency see FinCEN Advisory, \nFIN-2019-A003, “Advisory on Illicit Activity Involving Convertible Virtual Currency,” (May 9, 2019).\n25.\t See New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s testimony, “Following the Money: How Human Traffickers \nExploit the U.S. Financial Markets: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the \nCommittee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives,” (January 30, 2018).

Respondents frequently commented on the \nvalue of the cases in training employees, and indicated that more detail (i.e., red \nflags; what led to the institution’s identification of the activity and the subsequent \nSAR filing) would benefit them in identifying suspicious activity being conducted \nat their institutions.

Traffickers based in Thailand lured women to the United States \nthrough false promises of a better life.  To facilitate the transport of the victims, the organization \nengaged in visa fraud by creating false identification documents, and forced many of the \nvictims to enter into fraudulent marriages and debt bondage.  In exchange, each victim incurred \na debt of $55,000, which far exceeded actual expenses.  Once in the United States, the victims \nwere sent to various cities, isolated in a residence, and forced to pay off their debt by engaging \nin commercial sex acts.34\nTo conceal and redistribute the proceeds of the sex trafficking business, victims were forced \nto open U.S. bank accounts in Los Angeles in their own names.  Once an account was opened, \nhowever, traffickers based in the United States took control of the account, kept a percentage of \nthe cash generated, and sent the remainder back to the traffickers in Thailand.  Other members \nof the organization, the “facilitators,” rented the houses, apartments, and hotels, and facilitated \nthe transport of victims.\nThe organization used funnel accounts to launder money deposited in cities across the United \nStates to third-party launderers who made cash withdrawals in Los Angeles.35  According to data \nmade available to FinCEN, deposits were made in cash, and were just enough to cover account \ndebits.  To move funds to and from Thailand, the organization employed third-party money \nlaunderers who made bank accounts available and coordinated cash deposits and withdrawals.  \nBulk cash smuggling was another scheme used to physically transport proceeds to Thailand.  \nAccording to law enforcement, individuals were recruited to carry large volumes of cash in \nsuitcases and transport the money to Thailand.  To evade detection, the trafficking organization \npaid flight attendants to keep quiet, and in some limited instances, to transport bulk cash \nin their own luggage.  Money also was concealed in clothing and dolls that were shipped to \nThailand.  To date, law enforcement has recovered $1.5 million in cash, and testimony revealed \nthat more than $40 million was sent to Thailand by one money launderer alone.  \n34.\t For information on this case, see U.S. Department of Justice, “Twenty-One Additional Defendants Indicted for their \nRoles in Thai Sex Trafficking Enterprise,” (May 25, 2017); see also U.S. Department of Justice, “Thirty-Six Defendants \nGuilty for their Roles in International Thai Sex Trafficking Organization,” (December 13, 2018).\n35.\t For a definition of third-party money launderers see U.S. Department of Homeland Security, “Third Party Money \nLaunderers,” (Summer 2017).', 'INTERPOL Global Financial Fraud Assessment\nOPERATIONS STORM MAKERS I AND II\nIn 2022, during Operation STORM \nMAKERS, INTERPOL’s HTSM Unit started \nreceiving reports of trafficked victims \ntrapped in scam centres in South East \nAsia. In 2023, Operation STORM MAKERS \nII, which was aimed at identifying and \ndismantling criminal organizations engaged \nin human trafficking and smuggling of \nmigrants, entailed a unique focus on the \ntrend of human trafficking for the purpose \nof online fraud in Southeast Asia and other \nimpacted regions.\n7  INTERPOL.

INTERPOL \nfor official use only.\nFinancial Fraud and Forced Criminality\nINTERPOL research and analysis brought to \nlight a trend involving human trafficking for the \npurpose of forced online fraud. This trend refers \nto a modus operandi involving, on the one hand, \nVictims (A) - those who are trafficked and forced to \nconduct online fraud in so-called scam call centres \nor compounds and, on the other hand, Victims \n(B) - those who are defrauded of large sums of \nmoney by the trafficked victims. In the framework \nof Operation STORM MAKERS I & II, INTERPOL’s \nHuman Trafficking and Smuggling of Migrants \n(HTSM) Unit identified large-scale, cyber-enabled \nhuman trafficking operations perpetrated by Asian \ncrime syndicates for the purpose of forced online \nfraud across several Southeast Asian countries7. \nWhilst originally, trafficked individuals were mostly \nChinese-speaking victims, as the trend spread, \nboth recruitment and defrauding strategies further \nevolved to include victims from across the world8. \nAlthough it is important to note that not all scam \ncentres depend on the use of forced criminality, \ninformation recently shared by member countries \nwith INTERPOL suggests that scam centres or \ncompounds that do exploit trafficked victims have \nbegun to emerge across the globe. In Latin America, \nINTERPOL member countries have reported the \nidentification of a similar modus operandi where \nVictims (A), who typically originate from the region, \nare recruited through fake job advertisements, \nsometimes in public spaces. Once in the compounds, \ntheir identity documents are taken and they are \nforced to commit online financial fraud, mostly in \nthe form of advance-payment fraud, telecom fraud \nand impersonation fraud. These schemes tend to \ninvolve relatively small sums of money (between \nUSD 100 and USD 500), but they are replicated on \na large-scale through social media platforms and \nonline marketplaces. The fact that small sums are \ninvolved often discourages victims from reporting \nthe fraud, which prevents the identification of the \ncriminal structures behind these fraud schemes.\nFurthermore, INTERPOL has been notified of the \nexistence of similar scam centres in African countries, \ntargeting not only individuals and businesses in the \nAfrican region, but also worldwide. \nRegarding Europe, and based on cases shared with \nINTERPOL, scam centres were reportedly active \nsince the 2010s in European countries among \nother member countries. Moreover, and although \nintelligence gaps remain, there are reports pointing \nat the existence of human trafficking-fuelled scam \ncentres in Eastern European countries, where local \ngroups are believed to be collaborating with foreign \ncriminal organizations. In these cases, Victims (A) \nare reportedly from the Middle East.  \nAs this modus operandi continues to expand and \nthe profiles of Victims (A) become more diversified, \nwith victims from Asia, Africa and Latin America \nbeing held in scam centres, it is highly likely that the \npool of targeted Victims (B) will further enlarge. In \naddition, the emergence of AI-generated content \nwill likely increase the reach, sophistication and \ncapacity of fraud schemes conducted through \ntrafficking-driven scam centres, resulting in the \nexpansion of fraud worldwide.\n12', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n7\nFinancial Indicators \nTo help identify and report transactions possibly associated with human trafficking, FinCEN \nhas identified 10 new financial red flag indicators.  These red flags do not replace the red flags \nidentified in the 2014 Advisory, all of which remain relevant.31  The Financial Action Task Force \nreport on the “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking” also provides numerous indicators of \nmoney laundering related to human trafficking.32\n\tCustomers frequently appear to move through, and transact from, different geographic \nlocations in the United States.  These transactions can be combined with travel and \ntransactions in and to foreign countries that are significant conduits for human trafficking.33\n\tTransactions are inconsistent with a customer’s expected activity and/or line of business in \nan apparent effort to cover trafficking victims’ living costs, including housing (e.g., hotel, \nmotel, short-term rentals, or residential accommodations), transportation (e.g., airplane, taxi, \nlimousine, or rideshare services), medical expenses, pharmacies, clothing, grocery stores, and \nrestaurants, to include fast food eateries.   \n\tTransactional activity largely occurs outside of normal business operating hours (e.g., an \nestablishment that operates during the day has a large number of transactions at night), is \nalmost always made in cash, and deposits are larger than what is expected for the business \nand the size of its operations.  \n\tA customer frequently makes cash deposits with no Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments. \n\tAn individual frequently purchases and uses prepaid access cards.  \n\tA customer’s account shares common identifiers, such as a telephone number, email, and \nsocial media handle, or address, associated with escort agency websites and commercial sex \nadvertisements.\n\tFrequent transactions with online classified sites that are based in foreign jurisdictions.  \n\tA customer frequently sends or receives funds via cryptocurrency to or from darknet markets \nor services known to be associated with illicit activity.

Officers discovered two adult victims when they searched the motel room.  \nPolice located William “Tae” Harris, who was stopped while driving a suspect vehicle in the \narea.  He possessed a semi-automatic firearm.

HSI determined that at least three other West Side City Crips were operating a \nprostitution scheme in El Paso.  During a forensic extraction of Harris’ mobile phone, HSI \ndiscovered bitcoin transaction data and was able to exploit Harris’ bitcoin wallet information.  \nEvidence revealed that the group’s illicit activity revolved around the purchase of Vanilla \nVisa prepaid credit cards, which were then used to purchase bitcoin on the Paxful virtual \ncurrency exchange.  Those bitcoin were used to purchase prostitution ads on Backpage.com.  \nFurthermore, during Harris’ prosecution, HSI uncovered and disrupted an attempted murder-\nfor-hire in which Harris planned to have a key witness and her sister murdered.  \nIn January 2018, Hall and Harris were convicted and sentenced for violating several anti-\ntrafficking statutes.

The foreign financial institution then initiates the process of physically \nrepatriating (shipping) the cash back into the United States.186 Experience has shown a direct \ncorrelation between the smuggling of bulk currency, the heightened use of wire transfers, \nremote deposit capture (RDC) transactions or cash letter instruments from certain foreign \nfinancial institutions and/or jurisdictions, and bulk shipments of currency into the United \nStates from the same foreign financial institutions or jurisdictions.187  \nThe activity of shipping currency in bulk is not necessarily indicative of criminal or terrorist \nactivity.  Many individuals and businesses, both domestic and foreign, generate currency \nfrom legitimate cash sales of commodities or other products or services or certain industries \nsuch as tourism or commerce.  Also, intermediaries gather and ship currency from single or \nmultiple currency originators whose activities are legitimate.  Banks may legitimately offer \nservices to receive such shipments.  However, banks should be aware of the potential misuse \nof their services by shippers of bulk currency.  Banks should also guard against introducing \nthe monetary proceeds of criminal or terrorist activity into the financial system.  Banks \nshould have a clear understanding of the appropriate volumes of currency shipments that are \ncommensurate with the currency originator’s or shipper’s profile (size, location, strategic \nfocus, customer base, geographic footprint) and the economic activity that generates the cash. \nTo inform banks on the topic of bulk currency shipments, FinCEN has issued a number of \nadvisories that set forth certain activities that may be associated with currency smuggling.188 \nAccording to FinCEN, U.S. law enforcement has observed a dramatic increase in the \nsmuggling of bulk cash proceeds from the sale of narcotics and other criminal activities from \nthe United States into Mexico.  Although the FinCEN advisories deal specifically with the \nshipment of bulk currency to and from the United States and Mexico, the issues discussed \ncould be pertinent to shipping bulk currency to and from other jurisdictions as well.  Banks \nshould look at each situation on a case by case basis. \nLaw enforcement has identified the following activities that, in various combinations, may be \nassociated with currency smuggling:189 \n186 In certain cases, the foreign financial institution will ship the cash to its central bank or a money center bank \nin the foreign country in which the cash letter instrument originated.  Sometimes numerous layered transactions \nare used to disguise the origins of the cash, after which the currency may be returned directly to the United \nStates or further shipped to or through other jurisdictions.  The cash will be repatriated back to the United States \nfor the account of the U.S. bank in which the cash letter instrument was processed or funds transfer deposit was \nmade. \n187 For an example of these types of transactions, refer to National Drug Intelligence Center’s National Drug \nThreat Assessment 2008, Illicit Finance (December 2007). \n188 Refer to FinCEN’s Website for advisories on the shipment of bulk currency to and from the United States. \n189 Id.']","traffickers go after people most impacted and vulnerable, like what is said in the advisory and the report about trafficking in vulnerable communities. they use force, fraud, or coercion to recruit, harbor, or transport people for forced labor or sex acts. financial and behavioral indicators of trafficking were identified by FinCEN and law enforcement, and these help in reporting and fighting trafficking. also, goods made by forced or child labor can be illegally imported into the US, and Customs and Border Protection can issue orders to stop these goods. the Department of Labor keeps a list of goods and countries where forced or child labor is used, showing how trafficking and vulnerable communities connect to illegal imports.","['<1-hop>\n\nF I N C E N A D V I S O R Y 2 traffickers target those most impacted and vulnerable.4 Other effects of the pandemic (e.g., travel limitations, shelter-in-place orders, teleworking) also may affect the typologies and red flag indicators provided below.

"What financial and behavioral indicators have FinCEN and law enforcement identified to help detect human trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities, and how do these indicators relate to the industries and goods affected by trafficking as described in recent advisories and reports?","The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and law enforcement agencies have identified several financial and behavioral indicators to help detect human trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities. These indicators are crucial for financial institutions and their staff to recognize and report suspicious activities that may be associated with human trafficking. The indicators are categorized into financial and behavioral aspects, each providing insights into the operations of traffickers and the industries affected by trafficking.

### Financial Indicators

1. **Geographic Movement and Transactions**: Traffickers often move through and transact from different geographic locations, both domestically and internationally. These transactions may involve countries known as significant conduits for human trafficking.

2. **Inconsistent Transactions**: Transactions that do not align with a customer's expected activity or business line, such as covering living costs for trafficking victims, including housing, transportation, and medical expenses.

3. **Unusual Transaction Patterns**: Activities occurring outside normal business hours, predominantly in cash, with deposits larger than expected for the business size.

4. **Cash Deposits and Prepaid Cards**: Frequent cash deposits without corresponding Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments and the use of prepaid access cards.

5. **Common Identifiers**: Accounts sharing identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses associated with escort agency websites and commercial sex advertisements.

6. **Cryptocurrency and Darknet Markets**: Frequent transactions involving cryptocurrency to or from darknet markets or services associated with illicit activities.

7. **Third-party Payment Processors**: Use of third-party payment processors to conceal the originators and beneficiaries of transactions.

8. **Avoidance of Identification**: Customers avoiding transactions that require identification or trigger reporting requirements.

### Behavioral Indicators

1. **Third-party Control**: A third party speaking on behalf of the customer, insisting on being present, or attempting to fill out paperwork without consulting the customer.

2. **Document and Money Control**: A third party maintaining possession of all documents or money, or claiming to be related to the customer without knowing critical details.

3. **Use of Third-party Identification**: Prospective customers using third-party identification to open accounts.

4. **Signs of Abuse or Coercion**: Customers showing signs of poor hygiene, malnourishment, fatigue, physical or sexual abuse, or providing scripted or inconsistent stories.

5. **Lack of Knowledge**: Customers lacking knowledge of their whereabouts or unable to clarify where they live or stay.

### Industries and Goods Affected by Trafficking

Human trafficking affects a wide range of industries, both licit and illicit. These include hospitality, agriculture, janitorial services, construction, restaurants, care for persons with disabilities, salon services, massage parlors, retail, fairs and carnivals, peddling and begging, child care, domestic work, and drug smuggling and distribution. Goods produced by forced or child labor can also be illegally imported into the United States, with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection issuing Withhold and Release Orders against such merchandise.

### Relation to Industries

The financial and behavioral indicators are directly related to the industries affected by trafficking. For instance, transactions inconsistent with a business's expected activity may indicate the use of front companies in industries like massage parlors or nail salons, which can serve as fronts for trafficking operations. The use of prepaid cards and cryptocurrency is often linked to online escort services and advertisements for commercial sex acts. The presence of third-party control and signs of abuse are behavioral indicators that can be observed in industries where labor exploitation is prevalent, such as agriculture and construction.

### Conclusion

The comprehensive identification of these indicators by FinCEN and law enforcement is crucial for financial institutions to detect and report human trafficking activities. By understanding the financial and behavioral patterns associated with trafficking, institutions can play a significant role in combating this crime and protecting vulnerable communities. The integration of these indicators into Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and collaboration with law enforcement can enhance efforts to dismantle trafficking networks and bring perpetrators to justice.","['Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives,” (January 30, 2018); and Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 55-56, (July 2018). 27.

Human \ntraffickers can exploit individuals within the border of a country, and even in a victim’s own \nhome.  Human trafficking can also begin as human smuggling, as individuals who enter a \ncountry voluntarily and illegally are inherently vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and often \nowe a large debt to their smuggler.10\nBecause the information financial institutions collect and report is vital to identifying human \ntrafficking and stopping the growth of this crime, it is imperative that financial institutions \nenable their detection and reporting of suspicious transactions by becoming aware of the current \nmethodologies that traffickers and facilitators use.  It is also critical that customer-facing staff are \naware of behavioral indicators that may indicate human trafficking, as the only outside contact for \nvictims of human trafficking may occur when visiting financial institutions.\n10.\t See U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, “Human Trafficking vs Human Smuggling,” (Summer 2017); and \nsee also U.S. Department of State, “Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling: Understanding the Difference,” (June \n27, 2017).\n11.\t An establishment that provides food, drinks, dancing, and music, and is typically found in Latin American \ncommunities.   \n12.\t See Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 54 (July 2018).

New Typologies of Human Trafficking \nTo evade detection, hide their illicit proceeds, and profit off the backs of victims, human traffickers \nemploy a variety of evolving techniques.  Below are four typologies, identified in Bank Secrecy Act \n(BSA) data since FinCEN issued the 2014 Advisory, that human traffickers and facilitators have \nused to launder money.  \n1.  Front Companies \nHuman traffickers routinely establish and use front companies, sometimes legal entities, to hide \nthe true nature of a business, and its illicit activities, owners, and associates.  Front companies are \nbusinesses that combine illicit proceeds with those gained from legitimate business operations.  \nExamples of front companies used by human traffickers for labor or sex trafficking include massage \nbusinesses, escort services, bars, restaurants, and cantinas.11  In the case of businesses that act as \na front for human trafficking, typically the establishment appears legitimate with registrations \nand licenses.  The front company generates revenue from sales of alcoholic beverages and cover \ncharges.  Patrons, however, also can obtain illicit sexual services from trafficked individuals, \nusually elsewhere in the establishment.12  In addition, illicit massage businesses or nail and hair \nsalons can offer sexual services under the guise of legitimate businesses and/or exploit individuals \nfor the purpose of forced labor.13  Often, these establishments will appear to be a single storefront, \nyet are part of a larger network.  Payments for these illicit services are usually in cash, and \ntraffickers may invest the illicit proceeds in high-value assets, such as real estate and cars.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n4\n2.  Exploitative Employment Practices \nSome seemingly legitimate businesses use exploitative employment schemes, such as visa fraud and \nwage retention, to amass profit from labor and sex trafficking.  For instance, some labor recruiters \nmislead or defraud victims, taking advantage of workers before and after they enter the United States.  \nSome labor recruiters also mislead workers about the conditions and nature of a job, engage in contract \nswitching, and confiscate or destroy workers’ identity documents.14  Foreign nationals who have \nlegitimate temporary work or student visas also can be exploited.15\nAnother common practice is to charge exploitative fees to workers by withholding their salary \nor paying less than promised.  The trafficker claims that the fees cover the costs of recruitment \nor access to job opportunities.16  Recruitment fees can range from hundreds of dollars to tens of \nthousands of dollars, and take years to repay.17  Victims’ salaries are transferred to the traffickers \nor their co-conspirators via teller checks or wire transfers.  Proceeds also can be “disguised” as a \nlegitimate business expense, such as a cleaning service.  Financial institutions may see multiple \nemployees receiving their salaries in the same account, or payment for employment may be \nfollowed by immediate withdrawal or transfer into another account.18\n3.  Funnel Accounts \nFunnel accounts generally involve an individual or business account in one geographic area \nthat receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, from \nwhich the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between \nthe deposits and withdrawals.19  Human traffickers may use interstate funnel accounts to transfer \nfunds between geographic areas, move proceeds rapidly, and maintain anonymity.20  In labor and \nsex trafficking schemes, human traffickers may open accounts in their name, or escort victims to \na bank, and force them to open an account.21  Traffickers maintain control of the victims’ bank \naccounts through coercion, and direct victims to deposit money into their accounts and other \naccounts that the traffickers can access.22  In some cases, victims also are coerced or forced to wire \nproceeds via money services businesses (MSBs) to facilitate the funneling of proceeds.   \n14.\t U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017); see also U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, “Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February \n25, 2016).\n15.\t U.S. Department of Justice, Journal of Federal Law and Practice, “Human Trafficking,” Executive Office of United \nStates Attorneys, pp. 5 and 28, (November 2017).\n16.\t For more information see U.S. Department of Justice, “Leader of Human Trafficking Organization Sentenced to Over \n15 Years for Exploiting Guatemalan Migrants at Ohio Egg Farms,” (June 27, 2016); and U.S. Department of Justice, \n“Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February 25, 2016).  \n17.\t See U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017).\n18.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 28, (July 2018).\n19.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A005, “Update on U.S. Currency Restrictions in Mexico: Funnel Accounts and TBML,” \np. 1, (May 28, 2014).  \n20.\t See U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking,” \n(January 29, 2015).\n21.\t For additional behavioral indicators of human trafficking, see Section II, infra.\n22.\t Policies of certain large national banks to restrict third-party cash deposits for private customer accounts seem to have \nlessened the use of funnel account activity.', '22\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\nSAR Activity Review — Trends, Tips & Issues (Issue 22)\nHSI continues to explore ways in which the government and the private sector \ncan productively partner together to better identify and report on the suspicious \ntransaction activity related to HS/HT organizations.  HSI’s efforts related to Project \nSTAMP are in accordance with the guiding principle within DHS’s Strategic Plan of \nbuilding trust through collaboration and partnerships.\nAs part of Project STAMP, HSI aims to continuously identify and disseminate \ntypologies/red flag indicators related to money laundering by HS/HT organizations.  \nThe goal is to map out how these organizations use the financial sector, both \ndomestically and abroad, to collect payment for illegal services rendered and to \nshare these methods with the financial community, ultimately resulting in the \nshutting down of identified vulnerabilities.  A preliminary review of both active \nand closed HS/HT investigations has identified the following red flag indicators of \nsuspicious financial transactions associated with HS/HT organizations:\n2\n2 Structuring both deposits and international wires to avoid currency transaction \nreports;\n2\n2 Bank accounts being opened for businesses where the customer does not \nappear to have any involvement in activities related to the business;\n2\n2 Bank accounts opened in the name of companies that do not have any genuine \nbusiness activities that are consistent with the type of company they claim to \nbe;\n2\n2 Wire transfers from one business account to another that have no apparent ties;\n2\n2 Multiple ATM withdrawals at the daily maximum amount (in this case, $1,000 \nper day);\n2\n2 The use of credit card processing accounts with corresponding business fronts \nwith even number charges credited to the account ranging from $300 to $5,000 \ndollars;\n•\t Credit card payments to online escort services for advertising.

Alternative Payment Methods \nIn addition to payment via cash, traffickers also have accepted payment via credit cards, prepaid \ncards,23 mobile payment applications, and convertible virtual currency.24  Buyers of commercial \nsex use prepaid cards—a method of payment using funds paid in advance, which can be acquired \nanonymously with cash or on darknet websites—to register with escort websites and to purchase \nsexual services, flights, throw-away phones, and hotel rooms.25\nIllicit actors also use virtual currency to advertise commercial sex online.  For example, human \ntraffickers have purchased prepaid cards, and then used the cards to purchase virtual currency on \na peer-to-peer exchange platform.  Human traffickers then use the virtual currency to buy online \nadvertisements that feature commercial sex acts to obtain customers.26\nFinCEN also has identified transactions in which human traffickers use third-party payment \nprocessors (TPPPs) to wire funds, which gives the appearance that the TPPP is the originator or \nbeneficiary of the wire transfer and conceals the true originator or beneficiary.  For example, human \ntraffickers facilitate payments via TPPPs for the operation of online escort services and online \nstreaming services that use voice-over Internet protocol technology.  Human traffickers and their \nfacilitators use TPPPs to wire funds to individuals or businesses both domestically and abroad.27\nCase Study: Trafficking Involving Prepaid Cards and Bitcoin\nII.  Behavioral and Financial Red Flag Indicators \nof Human Trafficking\nIn applying the red flags below and the red flags in the 2014 Advisory, financial institutions are \nadvised that no single red flag is a clear indicator of human trafficking activity, although each can \nbe indicative of forced labor and/or sex trafficking.  Given that human trafficking is a predicate \noffense to money laundering, the financial red flags also may be indicative of other money \nlaundering-related offenses.  Financial institutions should consider additional factors, such as \na customer’s previous financial activity and the existence of typologies or other red flags, when \ndetermining whether transactions may be associated with human trafficking.  \n23.\t See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “National Money Laundering Risk Assessment,” p. 15-16, (2018).\n24.\t For more information about illicit activity involving convertible virtual currency see FinCEN Advisory, \nFIN-2019-A003, “Advisory on Illicit Activity Involving Convertible Virtual Currency,” (May 9, 2019).\n25.\t See New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s testimony, “Following the Money: How Human Traffickers \nExploit the U.S. Financial Markets: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the \nCommittee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives,” (January 30, 2018).

Revocable trusts are another method \nused to insulate the grantor and beneficial owner and can be designed to own and manage the \nbusiness entity, presenting significant barriers to law enforcement. \nWhile the majority of U.S.-based shell companies serve legitimate purposes, some shell \ncompanies have been used as conduits for money laundering, to hide overseas transactions, \nor to layer domestic or foreign business entity structures.298 For example, regulators have \nidentified shell companies registered in the United States conducting suspicious transactions \nwith foreign-based counterparties.  These transactions, primarily funds transfers circling in \nand out of the U.S. banking system, evidenced no apparent business purpose.  Domestic \nbusiness entities with bank-like names, but without regulatory authority to conduct banking, \nshould be particularly suspect.299 \nThe following indicators of potentially suspicious activity may be commonly associated with \nshell company activity: \n•\nInsufficient or no information available to positively identify originators or beneficiaries\nof funds transfers (using Internet, commercial database searches, or direct inquiries to a\nrespondent bank).\n•\nPayments have no stated purpose, do not reference goods or services, or identify only a\ncontract or invoice number.\n•\nGoods or services, if identified, do not match profile of company provided by respondent\nbank or character of the financial activity; a company references remarkably dissimilar\ngoods and services in related funds transfers; explanation given by foreign respondent\nbank is inconsistent with observed funds transfer activity.\n•\nTransacting businesses share the same address, provide only a registered agent’s address,\nor other address inconsistencies.\n•\nMany or all of the funds transfers are sent in large, round dollar, hundred dollar, or\nthousand dollar amounts.\n•\nUnusually large number and variety of beneficiaries receiving funds transfers from one\ncompany.\n•\nFrequent involvement of multiple jurisdictions or beneficiaries located in higher-risk\nOFCs.\n•\nA foreign correspondent bank exceeds the expected volume in its client profile for funds\ntransfers, or an individual company exhibits a high volume and pattern of funds transfers\nthat is inconsistent with its normal business activity.\n298 Failure to Identify Company Owners Impedes Law Enforcement.

In any event, the review should be \ncompleted in a reasonable period of time.  What constitutes a “reasonable period of time” \nvaries according to the facts and circumstances of the particular matter being reviewed and \nthe effectiveness of the SAR monitoring, reporting, and decision-making process of each \nbank.  The key factor is that a bank has established adequate procedures for reviewing and \nassessing facts and circumstances identified as potentially suspicious, and that those \nprocedures are documented and followed.72 \nFor situations requiring immediate attention, in addition to filing a timely SAR, a bank must \nimmediately notify, by telephone, an “appropriate law enforcement authority” and, as \nnecessary, the bank’s primary regulator.  For this initial notification, an “appropriate law \nenforcement authority” would generally be the local office of the IRS Criminal Investigation \nDivision or the FBI.  Notifying law enforcement of a suspicious activity does not relieve a \nbank of its obligation to file a SAR.73 \nSAR Quality \nBanks are required to file SARs that are complete, thorough, and timely.  Banks should \ninclude all known subject information on the SAR.  The importance of the accuracy of this \ninformation cannot be overstated.  Inaccurate information on the SAR, or an incomplete or \ndisorganized narrative, may make further analysis difficult, if not impossible.  However, \nthere may be legitimate reasons why certain information may not be provided in a SAR, such \nas when the filer does not have the information.  A thorough and complete narrative may \nmake the difference in determining whether the described conduct and its possible criminal \nnature are clearly understood by law enforcement.  Because the SAR narrative section is the \nonly area summarizing suspicious activity, the section, as stated on the SAR, is “critical.” \nThus, a failure to adequately describe the factors making a transaction or activity suspicious \nundermines the purpose of the SAR. \nTo inform and assist banks in reporting instances of suspected money laundering, terrorist \nfinancing, and fraud, FinCEN issues advisories and guidance containing examples of “red \nflags.”  In order to assist law enforcement in its efforts to target these activities, FinCEN \nrequests that banks check the appropriate box(es) in the Suspicious Activity Information \n71 Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group, “Section 5 — Issues and Guidance,” The SAR Activity Review — Trends, \nTips & Issues, Issue 10, May 2006, page 44.

In the Issues & Guidance section of this issue, we also include \ninformation and tips for filers on some of the changes in the new FinCEN SAR form, \nthe use of which will be required early in 2013.\nLaw Enforcement Cases\nThe single largest category of responses each year was a request for more (and \nmore detailed) law enforcement cases.  Respondents frequently commented on the \nvalue of the cases in training employees, and indicated that more detail (i.e., red \nflags; what led to the institution’s identification of the activity and the subsequent \nSAR filing) would benefit them in identifying suspicious activity being conducted \nat their institutions.  They also indicated they would like to see more variety in the \ntypes of institutions and products profiled in the cases.  Respondents also frequently \nrequested more feedback on the usefulness of SARs to law enforcement, specifically \nhow they use the reports and statistics on the use of BSA reports in cases.\nUnrelated to the survey, in early 2012, FinCEN conducted outreach to all our state \nand local law enforcement partners and asked those entities to provide feedback on \ntheir use of FinCEN data.

These indicators are relevant across a broad range of both licit and illicit industries in the United States, such as hospitality, agriculture, janitorial services, construction, restaurants, care for persons with disabilities, salon services, massage parlors, retail, fairs and carnivals, peddling and begging, child care, domestic work, and drug smuggling and distribution. Additionally, goods produced by forced or child labor can be illegally imported into the United States, and agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Labor monitor and act against such imports.

Unfortunately, in addition to the horrific toll on victims and their families, their very lives, dignity, and livelihood, human trafficking is now one of the most profitable and violent forms of international crime, generating an estimated $150 billion worldwide per year.5 In the United States, human trafficking now occurs in a broad range of licit and illicit industries (e.g., hospitality, agricultural, janitorial services, construction, restaurants, care for persons with disabilities, salon services, massage parlors, retail, fairs and carnivals, peddling and begging, child care, domestic work, and drug smuggling and distribution).6 Transactions involving proceeds generated by human trafficking can be the basis for federal criminal charges and asset forfeiture, as human trafficking and associated crimes constitute specified unlawful activities (SUAs) for the crime of money laundering.7 Since the 2014 Advisory, FinCEN collaborated with law enforcement to identify 20 new financial and behavioral indicators of labor and sex trafficking, and four additional typologies. This advisory provides: (i) new information to assist in identifying and reporting human trafficking, and to aid the global effort to combat this crime; and (ii) two illustrative recent case studies.

Here's a comprehensive guide based on the regulatory documents provided:

### Address Formatting:
1. **U.S., Canada, or Mexico Addresses:**
   - **Street Address:** Enter the permanent street address.
   - **City:** Enter the full city name without abbreviations.
   - **State/Territory/Province Code:** Use the two or three-letter code for the state, territory, or province. For Canadian provinces and territories, use the Canada Post Corporation codes. For Mexican states and territories, use the ISO 3166-2 three-letter codes.
   - **ZIP Code or Foreign Postal Code:** Enter the ZIP Code or foreign postal code without spaces or hyphens. For example, a ZIP Code like 12354-6120 should be entered as 123546120.
   - **Country Code:** Use the ISO 3166-1 two-letter country code (e.g., MX for Mexico, CA for Canada).

2. **Other Foreign Addresses:**
   - **Street Address:** Enter the street address.
   - **City:** Enter the city name fully spelled out.
   - **Postal Code:** Enter the postal code without spaces or special characters.
   - **Country Code:** Use the ISO 3166-1 two-letter country code.
   - If the address format does not conform to the FinCEN SAR format, record equivalent address information in the SAR address items and provide the full address in Part V of the SAR.

### Telephone Number Formatting:
- Record all telephone numbers, both foreign and domestic, as a single number string without formatting or special characters such as parentheses or hyphens. For example, a number in the format (NNN) NNN-NNNN should be recorded as NNNNNNNNNN.
- For telephone numbers that are part of the North American Numbering Plan (U.S., Canada, many Caribbean countries), include the area code and seven-digit telephone number.
- For other foreign telephone numbers, include the country code.

### Postal Codes and Country Codes:
- **Postal Codes:** Enter without spaces or hyphens.
- **Country Codes:** Use the ISO 3166-1 two-letter country codes for all countries.

### Additional Notes:
- If any part of the address is unknown, leave that item blank and check the ""Unknown"" box if available.
- No abbreviations are permitted in city names.
- If the address is in the U.S., leave the country field blank.
- If a foreign address contains other address information that does not conform to the FinCEN SAR address format, record equivalent address information in the SAR address items and the full address in Part V.

By following these guidelines, you ensure that the address and contact information on the FinCEN SAR is correctly formatted and compliant with regulatory requirements.","['for all U.S. territories.

For example, a report could be generated with the following criteria: currency \ntransactions of $7,000 or higher (in and out) for the preceding period (to be determined by \nthe examiner) before the date of examination.  The time period covered and the transaction \namounts may be adjusted as determined by the examiner.  The report should also capture: \n•\nThe customer information file (CIF) number, if available, or Social Security number\n(SSN)/taxpayer identification number (TIN).\n•\nThe date, amount, and account number of each transaction.\n•\nThe teller and branch or other applicable identifying information.\nThis data should be prepared in an electronic spreadsheet or database format to facilitate the \nsorting of the data.  The data can be sorted in a number of different criteria (e.g., by branch, \nby teller, by SSN/TIN, or CIF number, if available).  Analysis of this information should \nenable the examiner to determine whether CTRs and SARs have been appropriately filed. \nFunds Transfer Monitoring \nIf the bank does not have preset filtering reports for funds transfer record keeping and the \nidentification of suspicious transactions, the examiner should consider requesting a custom \nreport.  The examiner may consider requesting that the bank provide a report from its funds \ntransfer systems that identifies all funds transfers (in and out) for a time period determined by \nthe examiner.  The report should also capture: \n•\nThe customer’s full name, country of residence, SSN/TIN, and BSA/AML risk rating, if\napplicable.\n•\nThe date, amount, transaction type, and account number of each transaction.\n•\nThe originator’s name, country, financial institution, and account number.\n•\nThe beneficiary’s name, country, financial institution, and account number.\nThe bank should provide a list of bank internal codes necessary to fully identify the account \ntype, BSA/AML risk rating, country, transaction type, bank number, account number, and \nany other codes on the electronic reports.  The list should be sorted to identify those accounts \nthat do not contain sufficient originator or beneficiary information.

Assess the bank’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the \nreporting of international shipments of currency or monetary instruments. \nEach person145 (including a bank) who physically transports, mails, or ships currency or \nmonetary instruments in excess of $10,000 at one time out of or into the United States (and \neach person who causes such transportation, mailing, or shipment) must file a Report of \nInternational Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR).146 A CMIR must \nbe filed with the appropriate Bureau of Customs and Border Protection officer or with the \ncommissioner of Customs at the time of entry into or departure from the United States.  \nWhen a person receives currency or monetary instruments in an amount exceeding $10,000 \nat one time that have been shipped from any place outside the United States, a CMIR must be \nfiled with the appropriate Bureau of Customs and Border Protection officer or with the \ncommissioner of Customs within 15 days of receipt of the instruments (unless a report has \nalready been filed).  The report is to be completed by or on behalf of the person requesting \ntransfer of the currency or monetary instruments.  However, banks are not required to report \nthese items on a CMIR if they are mailed or shipped through the postal service or by \ncommon carrier.147 In addition, a commercial bank or trust company organized under the \nlaws of any state or of the United States is not required to report overland shipments of \ncurrency or monetary instruments if they are shipped to or received from an established \ncustomer maintaining a deposit relationship with the bank and if the bank reasonably \nconcludes the amounts do not exceed what is commensurate with the customary conduct of \nthe business, industry, or profession of the customer concerned. \nRegardless of whether an exemption from filing a CMIR applies, banks are not relieved of \nother monitoring and reporting obligations under the BSA.  Banks must report the receipt or \ndisbursement of currency in excess of $10,000 on a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) \nsubject to the exemptions at 31 CFR 1020.315.  Banks must also monitor for and report \nsuspicious activity. \n145 As defined in 31 CFR 1010.100 (mm), the term “person” means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a \ntrust or estate, a joint stock company, an association, a syndicate, joint venture or other unincorporated \norganization or group, an Indian Tribe (as that term is defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act), and all \nentities cognizable as legal personalities. \n146 The obligation to file the CMIR is solely on the person who transports, mails, ships or receives, or causes or \nattempts to transport, mail, ship, or receive.  No other person is under any obligation to file a CMIR.  Thus, if a \ncustomer walks into the bank and declares that he or she has received or transported currency in an aggregate \namount exceeding $10,000 from a place outside the United States and wishes to deposit the currency into his or \nher account, the bank is under no obligation to file a CMIR on the customer’s behalf (see FIN-1998-R002 \nformerly known as Treasury Administrative Ruling 88-2).  Also refer to CMIR guidance for common carriers of \ncurrency, including armored car services, FIN-2014-G002, August 1, 2014. \n147 In contrast, a bank is required to file a CMIR to report shipments of currency or monetary instruments to \nforeign offices when those shipments are performed directly by bank personnel, such as currency shipments \nhandled by bank employees using bank-owned vehicles.', '7.

"How does FinCEN guidance on human trafficking, as described in the advisory, relate to the requirements for filing a FinCEN SAR, particularly regarding the retention and documentation of supporting evidence for transactions that may involve proceeds from human trafficking?","The FinCEN guidance on human trafficking, as described in the advisory, provides specific instructions and considerations for financial institutions when filing a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) related to transactions that may involve proceeds from human trafficking. Here's how the guidance relates to the requirements for filing a FinCEN SAR, particularly regarding the retention and documentation of supporting evidence:

1. **SAR Filing Requirements**:
   - Financial institutions are required to file a SAR if they know, suspect, or have reason to suspect that a transaction involves funds derived from illegal activity, is designed to evade regulations, lacks a business or apparent lawful purpose, or involves the use of the financial institution to facilitate criminal activity.
   - When filing a SAR related to human trafficking, institutions should reference the advisory by including the key term “HUMAN TRAFFICKING FIN-2020-A008” in SAR field 2 (Filing Institution Note to FinCEN) and select SAR Field 38(h) (human trafficking).

2. **Narrative and Information Inclusion**:
   - The narrative portion of the SAR should include all available information on the victim, but the victim should not be reported as the subject of the SAR.
   - Financial institutions should include behavioral indicators, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses when possible to aid law enforcement investigations.
   - The narrative should describe the suspicious activity, including the ""who, what, when, where, why, and how"" of the transaction, and provide a clear and complete description of the suspicious activity.

3. **Supporting Documentation**:
   - Banks must retain copies of SARs and all supporting documentation for five years from the date of filing the SAR. Supporting documentation refers to all documents or records that assisted the bank in making the determination that certain activity required a SAR filing.
   - Filers should not include supporting documentation with the SAR itself but must describe in the narrative any supporting documentation not included in the spreadsheet. All supporting documentation must be made available to appropriate authorities upon request.
   - Filers can include a single Microsoft Excel file with no more than one megabyte of data as an attachment to the SAR to document transaction records that are too numerous to record in Part V.

4. **Confidentiality and Disclosure**:
   - The existence of a SAR and any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR are confidential, except as necessary to fulfill BSA obligations and responsibilities. Financial institutions must ensure that their internal controls minimize the risks of disclosure.
   - The underlying facts, transactions, and supporting documents of a SAR may be disclosed to another financial institution for the preparation of a joint SAR or in connection with certain employment references or termination notices, as authorized by law.

5. **Information Sharing**:
   - Information sharing among financial institutions is encouraged under the safe harbor authorized by section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act. This allows institutions to share information relating to transactions that may involve the proceeds of specified unlawful activities, including human trafficking, while remaining protected from civil liability.

In summary, the FinCEN guidance on human trafficking emphasizes the importance of detailed and accurate SAR filings, the inclusion of specific key terms and indicators, the retention and availability of supporting documentation, and the confidentiality of SAR-related information. Financial institutions are encouraged to be vigilant and proactive in identifying and reporting suspicious activities related to human trafficking, while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.","['not be reported as the subject of a SAR. Rather, all available information on the victim should be included in the narrative portion of the SAR. FinCEN further requests that financial institutions reference this advisory by including the key term: “HUMAN TRAFFICKING FIN-2020-A008” in SAR field 2 (Filing Institution Note to FinCEN) to indicate a connection between the suspicious activity being reported and the activities highlighted in this advisory. Additional information to include behavioral indicators, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses also should be included when possible to aid law enforcement investigations. 37. For further guidance related to the 314(b) Program, see FinCEN Section 314(b) Fact Sheet (November 2016), and FinCEN Guidance FIN-2009-G002, “Guidance on the Scope of Permissible Information Sharing Covered by Section 314(b) Safe Harbor of the USA PATRIOT Act,” (June 16, 2009). 38. 31 CFR §§ 1020.320, 1021.320, 1022.320, 1023.320, 1024.320, 1025.320,', 'Trafficking and Related Activity Human traffickers and their facilitators exploit the innocent and most vulnerable of our society for financial gain, employing an evolving range of money laundering tactics to evade detection, hide their proceeds, and grow their criminal enterprise.

These red flags do not replace the red flags \nidentified in the 2014 Advisory, all of which remain relevant.31  The Financial Action Task Force \nreport on the “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking” also provides numerous indicators of \nmoney laundering related to human trafficking.32\n\tCustomers frequently appear to move through, and transact from, different geographic \nlocations in the United States.  These transactions can be combined with travel and \ntransactions in and to foreign countries that are significant conduits for human trafficking.33\n\tTransactions are inconsistent with a customer’s expected activity and/or line of business in \nan apparent effort to cover trafficking victims’ living costs, including housing (e.g., hotel, \nmotel, short-term rentals, or residential accommodations), transportation (e.g., airplane, taxi, \nlimousine, or rideshare services), medical expenses, pharmacies, clothing, grocery stores, and \nrestaurants, to include fast food eateries.   \n\tTransactional activity largely occurs outside of normal business operating hours (e.g., an \nestablishment that operates during the day has a large number of transactions at night), is \nalmost always made in cash, and deposits are larger than what is expected for the business \nand the size of its operations.  \n\tA customer frequently makes cash deposits with no Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments. \n\tAn individual frequently purchases and uses prepaid access cards.  \n\tA customer’s account shares common identifiers, such as a telephone number, email, and \nsocial media handle, or address, associated with escort agency websites and commercial sex \nadvertisements.\n\tFrequent transactions with online classified sites that are based in foreign jurisdictions.  \n\tA customer frequently sends or receives funds via cryptocurrency to or from darknet markets \nor services known to be associated with illicit activity.  This may include services that host \nadvertising content for illicit services, sell illicit content, or financial institutions that allow \nprepaid cards to pay for cryptocurrencies without appropriate risk mitigation controls.\n\tFrequent transactions using third-party payment processors that conceal the originators and/\nor beneficiaries of the transactions.  \n\tA customer avoids transactions that require identification documents or that trigger reporting \nrequirements.\n31.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A008, “Guidance on Recognizing Activity that May be Associated with Human \nSmuggling and Human Trafficking – Financial Red Flags,” (September 11, 2014).\n32.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” pp. 65-70, (July 2018).\n33.\t For information on specific countries, and whether they are conduits for human trafficking, see U.S. Department of \nState, “Trafficking in Persons Report,” (June 2019).', 'Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n73 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nRecord Retention and Supporting Documentation \nBanks must retain copies of SARs and supporting documentation for five years from the date \nof filing the SAR.  The bank can retain copies in paper or electronic format.  Additionally, \nbanks must provide all documentation supporting the filing of a SAR upon request by \nFinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or federal banking agency.  “Supporting \ndocumentation” refers to all documents or records that assisted a bank in making the \ndetermination that certain activity required a SAR filing.  No legal process is required for \ndisclosure of supporting documentation to FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or \nfederal banking agency.77 \nProhibition of SAR Disclosure \nNo bank, and no director, officer, employee, or agent of a bank that reports a suspicious \ntransaction may notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been \nreported.  A SAR and any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, are \nconfidential, except as is necessary to fulfill BSA obligations and responsibilities.  For \nexample, the existence or even the non-existence of a SAR must be kept confidential, as well \nas the information contained in the SAR to the extent that the information would reveal the \nexistence of a SAR. 78  Furthermore, FinCEN and the federal banking agencies take the \nposition that a bank’s internal controls for the filing of SARs should minimize the risks of \ndisclosure. \nA bank or its agent may reveal the existence of a SAR to fulfill responsibilities consistent \nwith the BSA, provided no person involved in a suspicious transaction is notified that the \ntransaction has been reported.  The underlying facts, transactions, and supporting documents \nof a SAR may be disclosed to another financial institution for the preparation of a joint SAR, \nor in connection with certain employment references or termination notices to the full extent \nauthorized in 31 USC 5318(g)(2)(B).  The sharing of a SAR by a bank or its agent with \ncertain permissible entities within the bank’s corporate organizational structure for purposes \nconsistent with Title II of the Bank Secrecy Act is also allowed. \nAny person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR or the information \ncontained in a SAR, except when such disclosure is requested by FinCEN or an appropriate \nlaw enforcement79 or federal banking agency, shall decline to produce the SAR or to provide \n77 Refer to Suspicious Activity Report Supporting Documentation, June 13, 2007. \n78 FinCEN and the OCC issued final rules amending the confidentiality provisions of suspicious activity reports. \nThe rules clarify how, when, and to whom SAR information, and the existence of a SAR may be disclosed. \nRefer to 75 Fed. Reg. 75576 (December 3, 2010) (OCC) and 75 Fed. Reg. R 75593 (December 3, 2010) \n(FinCEN). \n79 Examples of agencies to which a SAR or the information contained therein could be provided include: the \ncriminal investigative services of the armed forces; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; an attorney \ngeneral, district attorney, or state’s attorney at the state or local level; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal Revenue Service or tax enforcement agencies at the state level; the \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control; a state or local police department; a United States Attorney’s Office; \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; and the U.S. Secret Service.  For \nadditional information, refer to Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group, “Section 5—Issues and Guidance,” The SAR \nActivity Review—Trends, Tips & Issues, Issue 9, October 2005, page 44 on the FinCEN Web site.', 'Appendix L: SAR Quality Guidance \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \nL–2 \n2/27/2015.V2 \naccounts, casinos, structuring, shell companies, bonds or notes, stocks, mutual funds, \ninsurance policies, traveler’s checks, bank drafts, money orders, credit or debit cards, prepaid \ncards, and digital currency business services.  The SAR includes a number of check boxes to \nrecord the instrument type(s)/payment mechanism(s) involved in the suspicious activity and \ntype(s) of suspicious activity being reported.  FinCEN requests that banks check the \nappropriate box(es) in the Suspicious Activity Information section and include certain key \nterms in the narrative section of the SAR.  If necessary, the instrument and type of suspicious \nactivity can be described in further detail in the narrative.  If a SAR narrative summarizes the \nflow of funds, the narrative should always include the source of the funds (origination) and \nthe use, destination, or beneficiary of the funds. \nWhen did the suspicious activity take place? \nIf the activity takes place over a period of time, indicate the date when the suspicious activity \nwas first noticed and describe the duration of the activity.  When possible, in order to better \ntrack the flow of funds, individual dates and amounts of transactions should be included in \nthe narrative rather than only the aggregated amount. \nWhere did the suspicious activity take place? \nThe narrative should indicate where the suspicious activity took place. .  The narrative should \nalso specify if the suspected activity or transactions involves a foreign jurisdiction. \nWhy does the filer think the activity is suspicious? \nThe SAR should describe, as fully as possible, why the activity or transaction is unusual for \nthe customer, considering the types of products and services offered by the filing bank’s \nindustry, and drawing any applicable contrasts with the nature and normally expected \nactivities of similar customers. \nHow did the suspicious activity occur? \nThe narrative should describe the “modus operandi” or the method of operation of the subject \nconducting the suspicious activity.  In a concise, accurate, and logical manner, the narrative \nshould describe how the suspect transaction or pattern of transactions was committed.  For \nexample, if what appears to be structuring of currency deposits is matched with outgoing \nfunds transfers from the accounts, the SAR narrative should include information about both \nthe structuring and outbound transfers (including dates, destinations, amounts, accounts, \nfrequency, and beneficiaries of the funds transfers). \nSupporting Documentation \nFilers can include a single, Microsoft Excel file with no more than one megabyte of data as \nan attachment to the SAR.  This file would be most suitable for documenting transaction \nrecords that are too numerous to record in Part V.  Do not include any other supporting \ndocumentation with the SAR.  Instead, describe in Part V other supporting documentation \nnot included in the spreadsheet.  Filers must retain all supporting documentation or a \nbusiness record equivalent for five (5) years from the date of the report.  All supporting \ndocumentation must be made available to appropriate authorities upon request.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n3\nIn contrast to human smuggling, human trafficking does not require movement.  Human \ntraffickers can exploit individuals within the border of a country, and even in a victim’s own \nhome.  Human trafficking can also begin as human smuggling, as individuals who enter a \ncountry voluntarily and illegally are inherently vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and often \nowe a large debt to their smuggler.10\nBecause the information financial institutions collect and report is vital to identifying human \ntrafficking and stopping the growth of this crime, it is imperative that financial institutions \nenable their detection and reporting of suspicious transactions by becoming aware of the current \nmethodologies that traffickers and facilitators use.  It is also critical that customer-facing staff are \naware of behavioral indicators that may indicate human trafficking, as the only outside contact for \nvictims of human trafficking may occur when visiting financial institutions.\n10.\t See U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, “Human Trafficking vs Human Smuggling,” (Summer 2017); and \nsee also U.S. Department of State, “Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling: Understanding the Difference,” (June \n27, 2017).\n11.\t An establishment that provides food, drinks, dancing, and music, and is typically found in Latin American \ncommunities.   \n12.\t See Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 54 (July 2018).

New Typologies of Human Trafficking \nTo evade detection, hide their illicit proceeds, and profit off the backs of victims, human traffickers \nemploy a variety of evolving techniques.  Below are four typologies, identified in Bank Secrecy Act \n(BSA) data since FinCEN issued the 2014 Advisory, that human traffickers and facilitators have \nused to launder money.  \n1.  Front Companies \nHuman traffickers routinely establish and use front companies, sometimes legal entities, to hide \nthe true nature of a business, and its illicit activities, owners, and associates.  Front companies are \nbusinesses that combine illicit proceeds with those gained from legitimate business operations.  \nExamples of front companies used by human traffickers for labor or sex trafficking include massage \nbusinesses, escort services, bars, restaurants, and cantinas.11  In the case of businesses that act as \na front for human trafficking, typically the establishment appears legitimate with registrations \nand licenses.  The front company generates revenue from sales of alcoholic beverages and cover \ncharges.

Financial institutions sharing information under the safe \nharbor authorized by section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act are reminded that they may share \ninformation relating to transactions that the institution suspects may involve the proceeds of \none or more SUAs and such an institution still will remain protected from civil liability under \nsection 314(b) safe harbor.  The SUAs listed in 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956 and 1957 include an array of \nfraudulent and other criminal activities, including fraud against individuals or the government.  \nFinCEN strongly encourages information sharing via section 314(b) where financial institutions \nsuspect that a transaction may involve terrorist financing or money laundering, including one \nor more SUAs.37\nSuspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)\nA financial institution is required to file a SAR if it knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect a \ntransaction conducted or attempted by, at, or through the financial institution involves funds \nderived from illegal activity, or attempts to disguise funds derived from illegal activity; is \ndesigned to evade regulations promulgated under the BSA; lacks a business or apparent lawful \npurpose; or involves the use of the financial institution to facilitate criminal activity.38 \nSAR Filing Instructions\nFinancial institutions should provide all pertinent available information in the SAR form and \nnarrative.  A potential victim of human trafficking should not be reported as the subject of a \nSAR.  Rather, all available information on the victim should be included in the narrative portion \nof the SAR.  FinCEN further requests that financial institutions reference this advisory by \nincluding the key term:\n“HUMAN TRAFFICKING FIN-2020-A008”\nin SAR field 2 (Filing Institution Note to FinCEN) to indicate a connection between the \nsuspicious activity being reported and the activities highlighted in this advisory.

Specifically, the guidance noted that the FinCEN SAR (and \nFinCEN CTR) “does not create new obligations or otherwise change existing \nstatutory and regulatory expectations of financial institutions.” \nDeadlines for adopting the FinCEN SAR and mandatory e-filing\nFollowing the initial release of the technical specifications for the new FinCEN SAR \non September 29, 2011, and the proposal mandating the electronic filing of reports \nsubmitted to FinCEN, industry raised concerns in its comments to the mandatory \ne-filing proposal regarding the potential challenge on meeting both requirements \nsimultaneously no later than June 30, 2012.  FinCEN provided substantial \nclarification on the interplay of these two separate, but related requirements in a \nnotice that established the deadline by which financial institutions must adopt the \nelectronic-only FinCEN SAR to be March 31, 2013, while restating the expectation \nthat mandatory e-filing would be required as of July 1, 2012.  That notice also made \nclear that until March 31, 2013, financial institutions could continue to file the older \nor “legacy” versions of the industry-specific SARs.  However, institutions may begin \nfiling on the FinCEN SAR prior to March 31, 2013.  The final notice establishing the \nrequirement of mandatory electronic filing for all reports submitted to FinCEN, with \ncertain limited exemptions, cemented that deadline as July 1, 2012.  \nAs of July 1, 2012, therefore, all financial institutions, unless granted a specific \nlimited-time exemption from FinCEN, must file all SARs electronically.  Institutions \nfiling paper SARs will be informed of their error and may be subject to civil money \npenalties for continued reporting requirement violations.  Starting April 1, 2013, all \nfinancial institutions must file the FinCEN SAR.  At that point, no electronically filed \nlegacy SARs will be accepted.\nCommon filing assistance inquiries\nTo assist financial institutions in their adoption of the new FinCEN SAR, FinCEN’s \nRegulatory Helpline and E-Filing Help Desk have been responding to a variety of \ntechnical and regulatory-related inquiries regarding the new report.  The remainder \nof this article provides helpful guidance, instructions, and other information for \nfinancial institutions regarding the appropriate way to complete a FinCEN SAR.  \nIn particular, we focus on how to complete a specific “Step” or “Item” with the \nnew FinCEN SAR, much of which can be found in the guidance documents and \nnotices highlighted earlier in this article or within Appendix C of the FinCEN SAR', 'Information Sharing — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n95 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nfor doing so, as long as it appropriately secures them and protects their confidentiality.  \nAudits should include an evaluation of compliance with these guidelines within their scope. \nFinCEN regularly updates a list of recent search transmissions, including information on the \ndate of transmission, tracking number, and number of subjects listed in the transmission.102 \nBankers and examiners may review this list to verify that search requests have been received.  \nEach bank should contact its primary federal regulator for guidance to ensure it obtains the \nsection 314(a) subject list and for updating contact information.103 \nVoluntary Information Sharing — Section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT \nAct (31 CFR 1010.540) \nSection 314(b) encourages financial institutions104 and associations of financial institutions105 \nlocated in the United States to share information in order to identify and report activities that \nmay involve terrorist activity or money laundering.  Section 314(b) also provides specific \nprotection from civil liability.106 To avail itself of this statutory safe harbor from liability, a \nfinancial institution or an association must notify FinCEN of its intent to engage in \ninformation sharing and that it has established and will maintain adequate procedures to \nprotect the security and confidentiality of the information.  Failure to comply with the \nrequirements of 31 CFR 1010.540 results in loss of safe harbor protection for information \nsharing and may result in a violation of privacy laws or other laws and regulations. \nIf a financial institution chooses to voluntarily participate in section 314(b), policies, \nprocedures, and processes should be developed and implemented for sharing and receiving of \ninformation. \nA notice to share information is effective for one year.107 The financial institution should \ndesignate a point of contact for receiving and providing information.  A financial institution \nshould establish a process for sending and receiving information sharing requests.  \n102 This list, titled “Law Enforcement Information Sharing with the Financial Industry,” is available on the \n“Section 314(a)” page of FinCEN Web site.  The list contains information on each search request transmitted \nsince January 4, 2005, and is updated after each transmission. \n103 Refer to the FinCEN Web site for section 314(a) contacts for each primary regulator. \n104 31 CFR 1010.540 generally defines “financial institution” as any financial institution described in 31 USC \n5312(a)(2) that is required to establish and maintain an AML compliance program.  Refer to FinCEN’s Section \n314(b) Fact Sheet dated October 2013 for general information. \n105 In July 2012, FinCEN issued an administrative ruling that clarified the meaning of “association of financial \ninstitutions.”  See FIN-2012-R006.  \n106 FinCEN has indicated that a financial institution participating in the section 314(b) program may share \ninformation relating to transactions that the institution suspects may involve the proceeds of one or more \nspecified unlawful activities (SUAs) and such an institution will still remain within the protection of the section \n314(b) safe harbor from liability.  Information related to the SUAs may be shared appropriately within the \n314(b) safe harbor to the extent that the financial institution suspects that the transaction may involve the \nproceeds of one or more SUAs and the purpose of the permitted information sharing under the 314(b) rule is to \nidentify and report activities that the financial institution suspects may involve possible terrorist activity or \nmoney laundering.

Alternative Payment Methods \nIn addition to payment via cash, traffickers also have accepted payment via credit cards, prepaid \ncards,23 mobile payment applications, and convertible virtual currency.24  Buyers of commercial \nsex use prepaid cards—a method of payment using funds paid in advance, which can be acquired \nanonymously with cash or on darknet websites—to register with escort websites and to purchase \nsexual services, flights, throw-away phones, and hotel rooms.25\nIllicit actors also use virtual currency to advertise commercial sex online.  For example, human \ntraffickers have purchased prepaid cards, and then used the cards to purchase virtual currency on \na peer-to-peer exchange platform.  Human traffickers then use the virtual currency to buy online \nadvertisements that feature commercial sex acts to obtain customers.26\nFinCEN also has identified transactions in which human traffickers use third-party payment \nprocessors (TPPPs) to wire funds, which gives the appearance that the TPPP is the originator or \nbeneficiary of the wire transfer and conceals the true originator or beneficiary.  For example, human \ntraffickers facilitate payments via TPPPs for the operation of online escort services and online \nstreaming services that use voice-over Internet protocol technology.  Human traffickers and their \nfacilitators use TPPPs to wire funds to individuals or businesses both domestically and abroad.27\nCase Study: Trafficking Involving Prepaid Cards and Bitcoin\nII.  Behavioral and Financial Red Flag Indicators \nof Human Trafficking\nIn applying the red flags below and the red flags in the 2014 Advisory, financial institutions are \nadvised that no single red flag is a clear indicator of human trafficking activity, although each can \nbe indicative of forced labor and/or sex trafficking.  Given that human trafficking is a predicate \noffense to money laundering, the financial red flags also may be indicative of other money \nlaundering-related offenses.  Financial institutions should consider additional factors, such as \na customer’s previous financial activity and the existence of typologies or other red flags, when \ndetermining whether transactions may be associated with human trafficking.  \n23.\t See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “National Money Laundering Risk Assessment,” p. 15-16, (2018).\n24.\t For more information about illicit activity involving convertible virtual currency see FinCEN Advisory, \nFIN-2019-A003, “Advisory on Illicit Activity Involving Convertible Virtual Currency,” (May 9, 2019).\n25.\t See New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s testimony, “Following the Money: How Human Traffickers \nExploit the U.S. Financial Markets: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the \nCommittee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives,” (January 30, 2018).

Exploitative Employment Practices \nSome seemingly legitimate businesses use exploitative employment schemes, such as visa fraud and \nwage retention, to amass profit from labor and sex trafficking.  For instance, some labor recruiters \nmislead or defraud victims, taking advantage of workers before and after they enter the United States.  \nSome labor recruiters also mislead workers about the conditions and nature of a job, engage in contract \nswitching, and confiscate or destroy workers’ identity documents.14  Foreign nationals who have \nlegitimate temporary work or student visas also can be exploited.15\nAnother common practice is to charge exploitative fees to workers by withholding their salary \nor paying less than promised.  The trafficker claims that the fees cover the costs of recruitment \nor access to job opportunities.16  Recruitment fees can range from hundreds of dollars to tens of \nthousands of dollars, and take years to repay.17  Victims’ salaries are transferred to the traffickers \nor their co-conspirators via teller checks or wire transfers.  Proceeds also can be “disguised” as a \nlegitimate business expense, such as a cleaning service.  Financial institutions may see multiple \nemployees receiving their salaries in the same account, or payment for employment may be \nfollowed by immediate withdrawal or transfer into another account.18\n3.  Funnel Accounts \nFunnel accounts generally involve an individual or business account in one geographic area \nthat receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, from \nwhich the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between \nthe deposits and withdrawals.19  Human traffickers may use interstate funnel accounts to transfer \nfunds between geographic areas, move proceeds rapidly, and maintain anonymity.20  In labor and \nsex trafficking schemes, human traffickers may open accounts in their name, or escort victims to \na bank, and force them to open an account.21  Traffickers maintain control of the victims’ bank \naccounts through coercion, and direct victims to deposit money into their accounts and other \naccounts that the traffickers can access.22  In some cases, victims also are coerced or forced to wire \nproceeds via money services businesses (MSBs) to facilitate the funneling of proceeds.   \n14.\t U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017); see also U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, “Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February \n25, 2016).\n15.\t U.S. Department of Justice, Journal of Federal Law and Practice, “Human Trafficking,” Executive Office of United \nStates Attorneys, pp. 5 and 28, (November 2017).\n16.\t For more information see U.S. Department of Justice, “Leader of Human Trafficking Organization Sentenced to Over \n15 Years for Exploiting Guatemalan Migrants at Ohio Egg Farms,” (June 27, 2016); and U.S. Department of Justice, \n“Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February 25, 2016).  \n17.\t See U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017).\n18.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 28, (July 2018).\n19.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A005, “Update on U.S. Currency Restrictions in Mexico: Funnel Accounts and TBML,” \np. 1, (May 28, 2014).  \n20.\t See U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking,” \n(January 29, 2015).\n21.\t For additional behavioral indicators of human trafficking, see Section II, infra.\n22.\t Policies of certain large national banks to restrict third-party cash deposits for private customer accounts seem to have \nlessened the use of funnel account activity.', '21\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\nSAR Activity Review — Trends, Tips & Issues (Issue 22)\nThis section of The SAR Activity Review discusses current issues, including those raised \nwith regard to the preparation and filing of SARs, and provides guidance to filers.  \nProject STAMP (Smugglers’ and Traffickers’ \nAssets, Monies and Proceeds)\nBy United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland \nSecurity Investigations\nProject Smugglers’ and Traffickers’ Assets, Monies and Proceeds (Project STAMP) \nis a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security \nInvestigations’ (HSI) enforcement initiative aimed at targeting the illicit proceeds \nearned by human smuggling and human trafficking (HS/HT) organizations.

The only outside contact they may have is when visiting financial institutions such as \nbank branches, check cashing counters, or money wiring services.  Consequently, it is important that \ncustomer-facing staff consider the following behavioral indicators when conducting transactions,28 \nparticularly those that also present financial indicators of human trafficking schemes discussed \nbelow.  As appropriate, such information should be incorporated into Suspicious Activity Report \n(SAR) filings and/or reported to law enforcement.29  When incorporated into SAR filings, it is \nimportant that behavioral indicators, and the staff who witnessed them, are included in the SAR \nnarrative so that information may be effectively searched for, and later used by, law enforcement.  \nThis list is not exhaustive and is only a selection of behavioral indicators:30\n\tA third party speaks on behalf of the customer (a third party may insist on being present and/\nor translating).\n\tA third party insists on being present for every aspect of the transaction.  \n\tA third party attempts to fill out paperwork without consulting the customer.\n\tA third party maintains possession and/or control of all documents or money.\n\tA third party claims to be related to the customer, but does not know critical details.\n\tA prospective customer uses, or attempts to use, third-party identification (of someone who is \nnot present) to open an account.  \n\tA third party attempts to open an account for an unqualified minor.\n\tA third party commits acts of physical aggression or intimidation toward the customer.  \n\tA customer shows signs of poor hygiene, malnourishment, fatigue, signs of physical and/or \nsexual abuse, physical restraint, confinement, or torture.\n\tA customer shows lack of knowledge of their whereabouts, cannot clarify where they live or \nwhere they are staying, or provides scripted, confusing, or inconsistent stories in response to \ninquiry.\n28.\t Additional resources discussing human trafficking and the role of financial institutions include the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security, Blue Campaign, “Resources Page”; U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Combatting Human \nTrafficking,” (January, 29, 2020); U.S. Department of State, “Tracking Suspicious Financial Activity to Address Human \nTrafficking,” (June 28, 2018); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to \nCombat Human Trafficking,” (January 29, 2015); and Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human \nTrafficking,” (July 2018).  \n29.\t To report suspicious activity indicative of human trafficking to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line, call 1-866-DHS-2-ICE (1-866-347-2423) 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek, every day of the year.

These proceeds can be the basis for federal criminal charges and asset forfeiture, as human trafficking and related crimes are considered specified unlawful activities for money laundering. To combat this, FinCEN provides information to assist in identifying and reporting human trafficking, including financial and behavioral indicators. In relation to FinCEN SAR filing requirements, financial institutions must retain copies of the FinCEN SAR and all supporting documentation, such as transaction records, for five years after the date of filing. Supporting documentation can include a Microsoft Excel compatible CSV file attached to the SAR if transaction records are too numerous to record in the narrative section. All supporting documentation must be made available to appropriate authorities upon request. This ensures that when suspicious activity related to human trafficking is detected and reported, the necessary evidence is preserved and accessible for law enforcement investigations, aligning FinCEN's advisory efforts with regulatory compliance for SAR filings.","['<1-hop>\n\nF I N C E N A D V I S O R Y 2 traffickers target those most impacted and vulnerable.4 Other effects of the pandemic (e.g., travel limitations, shelter-in-place orders, teleworking) also may affect the typologies and red flag indicators provided below. Unfortunately, in addition to the horrific toll on victims and their families, their very lives, dignity, and livelihood, human trafficking is now one of the most profitable and violent forms of international crime, generating an estimated $150 billion worldwide per year.5 In the United States, human trafficking now occurs in a broad range of licit and illicit industries (e.g., hospitality, agricultural, janitorial services, construction, restaurants, care for persons with disabilities, salon services, massage parlors, retail, fairs and carnivals, peddling and begging, child care, domestic work, and drug smuggling and distribution).6 Transactions involving proceeds generated by human trafficking can be the basis for federal criminal charges and asset forfeiture, as human trafficking and associated crimes constitute specified unlawful activities (SUAs) for the crime of money laundering.7 Since the 2014 Advisory, FinCEN collaborated with law enforcement to identify 20 new financial and behavioral indicators of labor and sex trafficking, and four additional typologies. This advisory provides: (i) new information to assist in identifying and reporting human trafficking, and to aid the global effort to combat this crime; and (ii) two illustrative recent case studies. The 2014 Advisory remains relevant, and provides information related to human smuggling, in addition to human trafficking. 4.

"How do FinCEN SAR electronic filing requirements address the documentation and retention of supporting materials related to transactions that may involve human trafficking, and what are the specific instructions for including and describing such documentation in the FinCEN SAR?","The FinCEN Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) electronic filing requirements provide specific guidance on the documentation and retention of supporting materials related to transactions that may involve human trafficking. Here is a comprehensive overview based on the regulatory guidance:

1. **Documentation and Retention Requirements:**
   - Financial institutions are required to retain copies of the FinCEN SAR and all supporting documentation for five years from the date of filing. This includes any business records or equivalent documentation that assisted in determining the need to file a SAR (31 CFR § 1010.430).
   - Supporting documentation may include transaction records, copies of instruments, receipts, sale or transaction records, photographs, and surveillance audio or video recordings. These must be made available to appropriate authorities upon request.

2. **Inclusion of Supporting Documentation in SAR:**
   - Filers can attach a single Microsoft Excel-compatible comma-separated values (CSV) file with no more than one megabyte of data to the FinCEN SAR. This file is suitable for documenting transaction records that are too numerous to record in Part V of the SAR.
   - The contents of the CSV file must be described in Part V of the SAR. No other supporting documentation should be included with the SAR; instead, other supporting documentation not included in the file should be described in Part V.

3. **Specific Instructions for Human Trafficking-Related SARs:**
   - When filing a SAR related to human trafficking, financial institutions should reference the advisory by including the key term “HUMAN TRAFFICKING FIN-2020-A008” in SAR field 2 (Filing Institution Note to FinCEN) and select SAR Field 38(h) for human trafficking.
   - The narrative section of the SAR should include all available information on the potential victim of human trafficking, but the victim should not be reported as the subject of the SAR.
   - Additional information such as behavioral indicators, email addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses should be included when possible to aid law enforcement investigations.

4. **Narrative Section Requirements:**
   - The narrative section is critical for understanding the nature and circumstances of the suspicious activity. It should provide a clear, complete, and concise description of the activity, including what was unusual or irregular that caused suspicion.
   - The narrative should describe the conduct or transaction(s) that caused suspicion, whether the transactions were completed or only attempted, who benefited from the activity, and any evidence of cover-up or attempts to deceive authorities.
   - Filers should not include legal disclaimers in the narrative and should only provide information about the financial institution’s business policies and practices if necessary for a complete understanding of the suspicious activity.

5. **Confidentiality and Disclosure:**
   - SARs and any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR are confidential. Financial institutions are prohibited from notifying any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported.
   - The underlying facts, transactions, and supporting documents of a SAR may be disclosed to another financial institution for the preparation of a joint SAR or in connection with certain employment references or termination notices, as authorized by law.

By adhering to these guidelines, financial institutions can ensure that they are in compliance with FinCEN's requirements for documenting and reporting suspicious activities related to human trafficking, while also aiding law enforcement in their investigations.","['the FinCEN SAR and their own supporting documentation for five (5) years after the date of filing. 6.

The SAR includes a number of check boxes to \nrecord the instrument type(s)/payment mechanism(s) involved in the suspicious activity and \ntype(s) of suspicious activity being reported.  FinCEN requests that banks check the \nappropriate box(es) in the Suspicious Activity Information section and include certain key \nterms in the narrative section of the SAR.  If necessary, the instrument and type of suspicious \nactivity can be described in further detail in the narrative.  If a SAR narrative summarizes the \nflow of funds, the narrative should always include the source of the funds (origination) and \nthe use, destination, or beneficiary of the funds. \nWhen did the suspicious activity take place? \nIf the activity takes place over a period of time, indicate the date when the suspicious activity \nwas first noticed and describe the duration of the activity.  When possible, in order to better \ntrack the flow of funds, individual dates and amounts of transactions should be included in \nthe narrative rather than only the aggregated amount. \nWhere did the suspicious activity take place? \nThe narrative should indicate where the suspicious activity took place. .  The narrative should \nalso specify if the suspected activity or transactions involves a foreign jurisdiction. \nWhy does the filer think the activity is suspicious? \nThe SAR should describe, as fully as possible, why the activity or transaction is unusual for \nthe customer, considering the types of products and services offered by the filing bank’s \nindustry, and drawing any applicable contrasts with the nature and normally expected \nactivities of similar customers. \nHow did the suspicious activity occur? \nThe narrative should describe the “modus operandi” or the method of operation of the subject \nconducting the suspicious activity.  In a concise, accurate, and logical manner, the narrative \nshould describe how the suspect transaction or pattern of transactions was committed.  For \nexample, if what appears to be structuring of currency deposits is matched with outgoing \nfunds transfers from the accounts, the SAR narrative should include information about both \nthe structuring and outbound transfers (including dates, destinations, amounts, accounts, \nfrequency, and beneficiaries of the funds transfers). \nSupporting Documentation \nFilers can include a single, Microsoft Excel file with no more than one megabyte of data as \nan attachment to the SAR.  This file would be most suitable for documenting transaction \nrecords that are too numerous to record in Part V.  Do not include any other supporting \ndocumentation with the SAR.  Instead, describe in Part V other supporting documentation \nnot included in the spreadsheet.

The bank can retain copies in paper or electronic format.  Additionally, \nbanks must provide all documentation supporting the filing of a SAR upon request by \nFinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or federal banking agency.  “Supporting \ndocumentation” refers to all documents or records that assisted a bank in making the \ndetermination that certain activity required a SAR filing.  No legal process is required for \ndisclosure of supporting documentation to FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or \nfederal banking agency.77 \nProhibition of SAR Disclosure \nNo bank, and no director, officer, employee, or agent of a bank that reports a suspicious \ntransaction may notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been \nreported.  A SAR and any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR, are \nconfidential, except as is necessary to fulfill BSA obligations and responsibilities.  For \nexample, the existence or even the non-existence of a SAR must be kept confidential, as well \nas the information contained in the SAR to the extent that the information would reveal the \nexistence of a SAR. 78  Furthermore, FinCEN and the federal banking agencies take the \nposition that a bank’s internal controls for the filing of SARs should minimize the risks of \ndisclosure. \nA bank or its agent may reveal the existence of a SAR to fulfill responsibilities consistent \nwith the BSA, provided no person involved in a suspicious transaction is notified that the \ntransaction has been reported.  The underlying facts, transactions, and supporting documents \nof a SAR may be disclosed to another financial institution for the preparation of a joint SAR, \nor in connection with certain employment references or termination notices to the full extent \nauthorized in 31 USC 5318(g)(2)(B).  The sharing of a SAR by a bank or its agent with \ncertain permissible entities within the bank’s corporate organizational structure for purposes \nconsistent with Title II of the Bank Secrecy Act is also allowed. \nAny person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR or the information \ncontained in a SAR, except when such disclosure is requested by FinCEN or an appropriate \nlaw enforcement79 or federal banking agency, shall decline to produce the SAR or to provide \n77 Refer to Suspicious Activity Report Supporting Documentation, June 13, 2007. \n78 FinCEN and the OCC issued final rules amending the confidentiality provisions of suspicious activity reports. \nThe rules clarify how, when, and to whom SAR information, and the existence of a SAR may be disclosed. \nRefer to 75 Fed.

The care with which the narrative is completed may determine whether \nthe described activity and its possible criminal nature are clearly understood by investigators. \nFilers must provide a clear, complete, and concise description of the activity, including what \nwas unusual or irregular that caused suspicion. This description should encompass the data \nprovided in Parts I through III, but should include any other information necessary to explain \nthe nature and circumstances of the suspicious activity. Filers should provide any information', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n7\nFinancial Indicators \nTo help identify and report transactions possibly associated with human trafficking, FinCEN \nhas identified 10 new financial red flag indicators.  These red flags do not replace the red flags \nidentified in the 2014 Advisory, all of which remain relevant.31  The Financial Action Task Force \nreport on the “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking” also provides numerous indicators of \nmoney laundering related to human trafficking.32\n\tCustomers frequently appear to move through, and transact from, different geographic \nlocations in the United States.  These transactions can be combined with travel and \ntransactions in and to foreign countries that are significant conduits for human trafficking.33\n\tTransactions are inconsistent with a customer’s expected activity and/or line of business in \nan apparent effort to cover trafficking victims’ living costs, including housing (e.g., hotel, \nmotel, short-term rentals, or residential accommodations), transportation (e.g., airplane, taxi, \nlimousine, or rideshare services), medical expenses, pharmacies, clothing, grocery stores, and \nrestaurants, to include fast food eateries.   \n\tTransactional activity largely occurs outside of normal business operating hours (e.g., an \nestablishment that operates during the day has a large number of transactions at night), is \nalmost always made in cash, and deposits are larger than what is expected for the business \nand the size of its operations.  \n\tA customer frequently makes cash deposits with no Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments. \n\tAn individual frequently purchases and uses prepaid access cards.  \n\tA customer’s account shares common identifiers, such as a telephone number, email, and \nsocial media handle, or address, associated with escort agency websites and commercial sex \nadvertisements.\n\tFrequent transactions with online classified sites that are based in foreign jurisdictions.  \n\tA customer frequently sends or receives funds via cryptocurrency to or from darknet markets \nor services known to be associated with illicit activity.  This may include services that host \nadvertising content for illicit services, sell illicit content, or financial institutions that allow \nprepaid cards to pay for cryptocurrencies without appropriate risk mitigation controls.\n\tFrequent transactions using third-party payment processors that conceal the originators and/\nor beneficiaries of the transactions.  \n\tA customer avoids transactions that require identification documents or that trigger reporting \nrequirements.\n31.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A008, “Guidance on Recognizing Activity that May be Associated with Human \nSmuggling and Human Trafficking – Financial Red Flags,” (September 11, 2014).\n32.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” pp. 65-70, (July 2018).\n33.\t For information on specific countries, and whether they are conduits for human trafficking, see U.S. Department of \nState, “Trafficking in Persons Report,” (June 2019).', 'Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \nElectronic Filing Requirements for the FinCEN Suspicious Activity Report (FinCEN SAR) \n83 \nElectronic Filing of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Reports” (General Specifications) and “FinCEN \nSuspicious Activity Report (FinCEN SAR) Electronic Filing Requirements.” \n \n2. Recording Information: Complete each FinCEN SAR by providing as much information as \npossible. Although all items should be completed fully and accurately, items marked with an \nasterisk (*) must be completed even when the required data are unknown.  Filers must follow \nthe electronic filing instructions for these items by providing the required data or, if instructions \npermit, by checking the box “Unknown” to indicate that the required data was unknown. Items \nthat do not begin with an asterisk must be completed if the data are known and will be left \nblank if the data are unknown. If an item’s instructions differ from this general instruction, the \nitem instructions must be followed. These instructions supersede all prior SAR instructions and \nFinCEN guidance on use of special responses in SAR items when the data are unknown or not \navailable in an electronic filing. Therefore, the use of special responses such as “UNKNOWN,” \n“NONE,” “NOT APPLICABLE,” or “XX” and their variants is prohibited in the FinCEN SAR.  \n \nNOTE:  Throughout these instructions the phrase “check box” and similar wording is used to \ndenote checking an appropriate box in certain data items on the discrete FinCEN SAR. This is \ndeemed equivalent to instructions in the Electronic Filing Requirements to enter appropriate \ncodes in the same data items in transmission files. For example, the requirement to check box 1 \n“Initial report” in the discrete FinCEN SAR is the equivalent of entering code “A” in “Type of \nFiling” in the Electronic Filing Requirements Suspicious Activity Information (3A) Record. In \nsome discrete FinCEN SAR data items check boxes have been replaced by drop-down lists.  \n \nNOTE:  Throughout these instructions there are requirements to complete items multiple times \nin a discrete FinCEN SAR if the filer has multiple entries for that item. This is deemed \nequivalent to completing multiple records for that item in the Electronic Filing Requirements. \nFor example, these instructions direct filers to complete multiple Item 6 “Alternate name” fields \nif the filer has knowledge of multiple alternate names for a subject. This is equivalent to a batch \nfiler completing multiple Subject Alternative Name (4D) Records for the same subject.  \n \n3. Corrected/Amended Reports:  A corrected report on a previously-filed FinCEN SAR or prior \nSAR versions must be filed whenever errors are discovered in the data reported in that FinCEN \nSAR. An amended report must be filed on a previously-filed FinCEN SAR or prior SAR \nversions whenever new data about a reported suspicious activity is discovered and \ncircumstances will not justify filing a continuing report (see General Instruction 4). Both \ncorrected and amended reports must be completed in their entirety, with the necessary \ncorrections or amendments made to the data. In both cases box 1b “Correct/Amend prior \nreport” must be checked. If known, the prior report’s Document Control Number (DCN) or BSA \nIdentifier (BSA ID) must be entered in field 1e. If the prior report’s DCN or BSA ID is unknown, \nfield 1e should be zero-filled. All corrections or amendments must be described completely at \nthe beginning of the Part V Suspicious Activity Information – Narrative section. If a FinCEN \nSAR is filed to correct or amend a prior SAR version, the FinCEN SAR must be completed in its \nentirety. This includes FinCEN SAR items that apply to the suspicious activity but were not', 'Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n72 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nsection and include certain key terms in the narrative section of the SAR.  The advisories and \nguidance can be found on FinCEN Web site.74 \nBy their nature, SAR narratives are subjective, and examiners generally should not criticize \nthe bank’s interpretation of the facts.  Nevertheless, banks should ensure that SAR narratives \nare complete, thoroughly describe the extent and nature of the suspicious activity, and are \nincluded within the SAR.  The BSAR accepts a single, Microsoft Excel-compatible comma \nseparated value (csv) file no larger than one (1) megabyte as an attachment as part of the \nreport.  This capability allows a bank to include transactional data such as specific financial \ntransactions and funds transfers or other analytics that are more readable or usable in this \nformat than it would be if otherwise included in the narrative.  Such an attachment is be \nconsidered a part of the narrative and is not considered to be a substitute for the narrative.  \nFor example, narratives should not simply state “see attachment” if the bank included a csv \nattachment.  As with other information that may be prepared in connection with the filing of \na SAR, an attachment is considered supporting documentation and should be treated as \nconfidential to the extent that it indicates the existence of a SAR.  \nMore specific guidance is available in Appendix L (“SAR Quality Guidance”)  to assist \nbanks in writing, and assist examiners in evaluating, SAR narratives.75 \nNotifying Board of Directors of SAR Filings \nBanks are required by the SAR regulations of their federal banking agency to notify the \nboard of directors or an appropriate board committee that SARs have been filed.  However, \nthe regulations do not mandate a particular notification format and banks should have \nflexibility in structuring their format.  Therefore, banks may, but are not required to, provide \nactual copies of SARs to the board of directors or a board committee.  Alternatively, banks \nmay opt to provide summaries, tables of SARs filed for specific violation types, or other \nforms of notification.  Regardless of the notification format used by the bank, management \nshould provide sufficient information on its SAR filings to the board of directors or an \nappropriate committee in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties, while being mindful of the \nconfidential nature of the SAR.76 \n74 For more information, refer to SAR Advisory Key Terms on the FinCEN Web site. \n75 Guidance to assist banks in filing SARs can be found in the FinCEN Suspicious Activity Report (FinCEN \nSAR) Electronic Filing Requirements Release Date October 2012, Version 1.2.  Other guidance available from \nFinCEN includes “Suggestions for Addressing Common Errors Noted in Suspicious Activity Reporting” \n(October 10, 2007). \n76 As noted in the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group’s The SAR Activity Review — Trends, Tips & Issues, Issue \n2, June 2001, “In the rare instance when suspicious activity is related to an individual in the organization, such \nas the president or one of the members of the board of directors, the established policy that would require \nnotification of a SAR filing to such an individual should not be followed.  Deviations to established policies and \nprocedures so as to avoid notification of a SAR filing to a subject of the SAR should be documented and \nappropriate uninvolved senior organizational personnel should be so advised.”', 'Appendix T: BSA E-Filing System \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \nT–10 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nFile errors are classified as primary or secondary errors, depending on their importance.  \nPrimary errors are file errors that violate electronic filing requirements or report instructions \nand so degrade data quality that they must be corrected.  Primary errors make it difficult for \nregulators, analysts, and law enforcement investigators to locate the reports in the database or \nidentify the nature and circumstances of the filing.  Examples of such errors include blank \nlast names or legal names, missing financial institution Employer Identification Numbers, or \ninvalid entries in the transaction date field.  Attachment A – Error Code List identifies \nprimary errors by adding an asterisk (*) to the four digit error code. \nSecondary errors are file errors that violate electronic filing requirements or report \ninstructions but have a lesser impact on data quality.  Examples of secondary errors are ZIP \nCodes that end in four zeroes (e.g. 123450000), blank or invalid financial institution address \ninformation, or invalid telephone numbers. \nError Correction \nA detailed description of error codes can be found in Attachment A - Error Code List in the \nFinCEN Currency Transaction Report Electronic Filing Requirements and the FinCEN \nSuspicious Activity Report Electronic Filing Requirements. \nAttachment B – Error Correction Instructions are also contained in the Electronic Filing \nRequirements documents and identify the requirements and procedures for correcting \nFinCEN errors reported to batch filers during the FinCEN acknowledgement process. \nThere are also batch file specifications for the FinCEN DOEP and the FinCEN FBAR in the \nElectronic Filing Requirements documents for those types of submissions.   \nCorrection Requirements \nFilers should immediately correct and resubmit a batch file rejected for fatal errors or for \nlarge numbers of file errors when notified by FinCEN the batch file was not accepted.  \nRejection of a batch file does not relieve the filer of the responsibility to file within the \nrequired time frames established by the BSA regulations. \nAn accepted batch file containing primary errors, must be re-filed as corrected reports with \nthe primary errors and any secondary errors corrected.  FinCEN reports that contain only \nsecondary errors need not be corrected. \nNaming Conventions \nThe “Filing Name” fields on the BSA E-Filing Header page are for the bank to use as an \ninternal filing in such a manner as to distinguish it from other filings submitted.  As such, \neach file name should be unique.  This will be especially useful when using the Track Status \nfeature in BSA E-Filing.  Naming conventions optimize the bank’s ability to distinguish files \nfrom one another, but not to disclose sensitive information contained on the BSA reports.  \nHaving a standard naming convention will be even more important if the organization has \nmultiple people responsible for filing.  Each filer will want to distinguish their filings from \nones submitted by other filers within the organization.  Conventions may include a filer’s \nabbreviated name or initials, date of submission, and a sequence number of filings in one day', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n3\nIn contrast to human smuggling, human trafficking does not require movement.  Human \ntraffickers can exploit individuals within the border of a country, and even in a victim’s own \nhome.  Human trafficking can also begin as human smuggling, as individuals who enter a \ncountry voluntarily and illegally are inherently vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and often \nowe a large debt to their smuggler.10\nBecause the information financial institutions collect and report is vital to identifying human \ntrafficking and stopping the growth of this crime, it is imperative that financial institutions \nenable their detection and reporting of suspicious transactions by becoming aware of the current \nmethodologies that traffickers and facilitators use.  It is also critical that customer-facing staff are \naware of behavioral indicators that may indicate human trafficking, as the only outside contact for \nvictims of human trafficking may occur when visiting financial institutions.\n10.\t See U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, “Human Trafficking vs Human Smuggling,” (Summer 2017); and \nsee also U.S. Department of State, “Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling: Understanding the Difference,” (June \n27, 2017).\n11.\t An establishment that provides food, drinks, dancing, and music, and is typically found in Latin American \ncommunities.   \n12.\t See Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 54 (July 2018).

New Typologies of Human Trafficking \nTo evade detection, hide their illicit proceeds, and profit off the backs of victims, human traffickers \nemploy a variety of evolving techniques.  Below are four typologies, identified in Bank Secrecy Act \n(BSA) data since FinCEN issued the 2014 Advisory, that human traffickers and facilitators have \nused to launder money.  \n1.  Front Companies \nHuman traffickers routinely establish and use front companies, sometimes legal entities, to hide \nthe true nature of a business, and its illicit activities, owners, and associates.  Front companies are \nbusinesses that combine illicit proceeds with those gained from legitimate business operations.  \nExamples of front companies used by human traffickers for labor or sex trafficking include massage \nbusinesses, escort services, bars, restaurants, and cantinas.11  In the case of businesses that act as \na front for human trafficking, typically the establishment appears legitimate with registrations \nand licenses.  The front company generates revenue from sales of alcoholic beverages and cover \ncharges.  Patrons, however, also can obtain illicit sexual services from trafficked individuals, \nusually elsewhere in the establishment.12  In addition, illicit massage businesses or nail and hair \nsalons can offer sexual services under the guise of legitimate businesses and/or exploit individuals \nfor the purpose of forced labor.13  Often, these establishments will appear to be a single storefront, \nyet are part of a larger network.  Payments for these illicit services are usually in cash, and \ntraffickers may invest the illicit proceeds in high-value assets, such as real estate and cars.', '1\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \n(FinCEN) is issuing this advisory to help save lives, \nand to protect the most vulnerable in our society \nfrom predators and cowards who prey on the \ninnocent and defenseless for money and greed.

The final notice establishing the \nrequirement of mandatory electronic filing for all reports submitted to FinCEN, with \ncertain limited exemptions, cemented that deadline as July 1, 2012.  \nAs of July 1, 2012, therefore, all financial institutions, unless granted a specific \nlimited-time exemption from FinCEN, must file all SARs electronically.  Institutions \nfiling paper SARs will be informed of their error and may be subject to civil money \npenalties for continued reporting requirement violations.  Starting April 1, 2013, all \nfinancial institutions must file the FinCEN SAR.  At that point, no electronically filed \nlegacy SARs will be accepted.\nCommon filing assistance inquiries\nTo assist financial institutions in their adoption of the new FinCEN SAR, FinCEN’s \nRegulatory Helpline and E-Filing Help Desk have been responding to a variety of \ntechnical and regulatory-related inquiries regarding the new report.

How U.S. Department of the Treasury talk about human trafficking and what they do about goods made by forced labor?,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury addresses human trafficking and goods made by forced labor through various regulatory measures and initiatives, as outlined in the provided documents. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### Human Trafficking

1. **Recognition and Reporting**: The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issues advisories to help financial institutions recognize and report suspicious activities related to human trafficking. These advisories include behavioral and financial red flag indicators that can help identify potential trafficking activities. Financial institutions are encouraged to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) when they suspect human trafficking, using specific indicators and narratives to assist law enforcement.

2. **Financial Indicators and Typologies**: FinCEN has identified various financial red flags and typologies associated with human trafficking. These include the use of funnel accounts, front companies, exploitative employment practices, and alternative payment methods like prepaid cards and cryptocurrencies. These methods are used by traffickers to launder money and conceal their activities.

3. **Collaboration with Law Enforcement**: FinCEN collaborates with law enforcement agencies to identify new financial and behavioral indicators of trafficking. This collaboration helps in updating advisories and enhancing the detection and reporting of trafficking-related activities.

4. **Project STAMP**: This initiative by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) targets the illicit proceeds of human smuggling and trafficking organizations. It focuses on attacking these organizations from an anti-money laundering stance, identifying key members, and seizing assets to disrupt their operations.

5. **Public Awareness and Training**: The Treasury Department emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships in combating human trafficking. Financial institutions and businesses are encouraged to partner with HSI, report suspicious activities, and stay informed through resources like the Cornerstone Report.

### Goods Made by Forced Labor

1. **Withhold and Release Orders**: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issues Withhold and Release Orders against imported goods suspected of being produced with forced or child labor. This measure prevents such goods from entering the U.S. market.

2. **List of Goods and Source Countries**: The U.S. Department of Labor maintains a list of goods and their source countries that are believed to be produced by forced or child labor, in violation of international standards. This list helps in identifying and restricting the import of such goods.

3. **International Standards and Compliance**: The U.S. government aligns its actions with international standards to combat forced labor. This includes maintaining compliance with laws and regulations that prohibit the importation of goods made with forced labor.

### Overall Approach

The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through FinCEN and in collaboration with other government agencies, takes a comprehensive approach to combat human trafficking and the importation of goods made by forced labor. This involves regulatory measures, financial intelligence, law enforcement collaboration, public-private partnerships, and adherence to international standards. The goal is to disrupt the financial networks that support trafficking and forced labor, protect victims, and uphold human rights.","['imported into the United States.

The only outside contact they may have is when visiting financial institutions such as \nbank branches, check cashing counters, or money wiring services.  Consequently, it is important that \ncustomer-facing staff consider the following behavioral indicators when conducting transactions,28 \nparticularly those that also present financial indicators of human trafficking schemes discussed \nbelow.  As appropriate, such information should be incorporated into Suspicious Activity Report \n(SAR) filings and/or reported to law enforcement.29  When incorporated into SAR filings, it is \nimportant that behavioral indicators, and the staff who witnessed them, are included in the SAR \nnarrative so that information may be effectively searched for, and later used by, law enforcement.  \nThis list is not exhaustive and is only a selection of behavioral indicators:30\n\tA third party speaks on behalf of the customer (a third party may insist on being present and/\nor translating).\n\tA third party insists on being present for every aspect of the transaction.  \n\tA third party attempts to fill out paperwork without consulting the customer.\n\tA third party maintains possession and/or control of all documents or money.\n\tA third party claims to be related to the customer, but does not know critical details.\n\tA prospective customer uses, or attempts to use, third-party identification (of someone who is \nnot present) to open an account.  \n\tA third party attempts to open an account for an unqualified minor.\n\tA third party commits acts of physical aggression or intimidation toward the customer.  \n\tA customer shows signs of poor hygiene, malnourishment, fatigue, signs of physical and/or \nsexual abuse, physical restraint, confinement, or torture.\n\tA customer shows lack of knowledge of their whereabouts, cannot clarify where they live or \nwhere they are staying, or provides scripted, confusing, or inconsistent stories in response to \ninquiry.\n28.\t Additional resources discussing human trafficking and the role of financial institutions include the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security, Blue Campaign, “Resources Page”; U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Combatting Human \nTrafficking,” (January, 29, 2020); U.S. Department of State, “Tracking Suspicious Financial Activity to Address Human \nTrafficking,” (June 28, 2018); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to \nCombat Human Trafficking,” (January 29, 2015); and Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human \nTrafficking,” (July 2018).  \n29.\t To report suspicious activity indicative of human trafficking to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line, call 1-866-DHS-2-ICE (1-866-347-2423) 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek, every day of the year.

Alternative Payment Methods \nIn addition to payment via cash, traffickers also have accepted payment via credit cards, prepaid \ncards,23 mobile payment applications, and convertible virtual currency.24  Buyers of commercial \nsex use prepaid cards—a method of payment using funds paid in advance, which can be acquired \nanonymously with cash or on darknet websites—to register with escort websites and to purchase \nsexual services, flights, throw-away phones, and hotel rooms.25\nIllicit actors also use virtual currency to advertise commercial sex online.  For example, human \ntraffickers have purchased prepaid cards, and then used the cards to purchase virtual currency on \na peer-to-peer exchange platform.  Human traffickers then use the virtual currency to buy online \nadvertisements that feature commercial sex acts to obtain customers.26\nFinCEN also has identified transactions in which human traffickers use third-party payment \nprocessors (TPPPs) to wire funds, which gives the appearance that the TPPP is the originator or \nbeneficiary of the wire transfer and conceals the true originator or beneficiary.  For example, human \ntraffickers facilitate payments via TPPPs for the operation of online escort services and online \nstreaming services that use voice-over Internet protocol technology.  Human traffickers and their \nfacilitators use TPPPs to wire funds to individuals or businesses both domestically and abroad.27\nCase Study: Trafficking Involving Prepaid Cards and Bitcoin\nII.  Behavioral and Financial Red Flag Indicators \nof Human Trafficking\nIn applying the red flags below and the red flags in the 2014 Advisory, financial institutions are \nadvised that no single red flag is a clear indicator of human trafficking activity, although each can \nbe indicative of forced labor and/or sex trafficking.  Given that human trafficking is a predicate \noffense to money laundering, the financial red flags also may be indicative of other money \nlaundering-related offenses.  Financial institutions should consider additional factors, such as \na customer’s previous financial activity and the existence of typologies or other red flags, when \ndetermining whether transactions may be associated with human trafficking.  \n23.\t See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “National Money Laundering Risk Assessment,” p. 15-16, (2018).\n24.\t For more information about illicit activity involving convertible virtual currency see FinCEN Advisory, \nFIN-2019-A003, “Advisory on Illicit Activity Involving Convertible Virtual Currency,” (May 9, 2019).\n25.\t See New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s testimony, “Following the Money: How Human Traffickers \nExploit the U.S. Financial Markets: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the \nCommittee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives,” (January 30, 2018).

Human \ntraffickers can exploit individuals within the border of a country, and even in a victim’s own \nhome.  Human trafficking can also begin as human smuggling, as individuals who enter a \ncountry voluntarily and illegally are inherently vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and often \nowe a large debt to their smuggler.10\nBecause the information financial institutions collect and report is vital to identifying human \ntrafficking and stopping the growth of this crime, it is imperative that financial institutions \nenable their detection and reporting of suspicious transactions by becoming aware of the current \nmethodologies that traffickers and facilitators use.  It is also critical that customer-facing staff are \naware of behavioral indicators that may indicate human trafficking, as the only outside contact for \nvictims of human trafficking may occur when visiting financial institutions.\n10.\t See U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, “Human Trafficking vs Human Smuggling,” (Summer 2017); and \nsee also U.S. Department of State, “Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling: Understanding the Difference,” (June \n27, 2017).\n11.\t An establishment that provides food, drinks, dancing, and music, and is typically found in Latin American \ncommunities.   \n12.\t See Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 54 (July 2018).

New Typologies of Human Trafficking \nTo evade detection, hide their illicit proceeds, and profit off the backs of victims, human traffickers \nemploy a variety of evolving techniques.  Below are four typologies, identified in Bank Secrecy Act \n(BSA) data since FinCEN issued the 2014 Advisory, that human traffickers and facilitators have \nused to launder money.  \n1.  Front Companies \nHuman traffickers routinely establish and use front companies, sometimes legal entities, to hide \nthe true nature of a business, and its illicit activities, owners, and associates.  Front companies are \nbusinesses that combine illicit proceeds with those gained from legitimate business operations.  \nExamples of front companies used by human traffickers for labor or sex trafficking include massage \nbusinesses, escort services, bars, restaurants, and cantinas.11  In the case of businesses that act as \na front for human trafficking, typically the establishment appears legitimate with registrations \nand licenses.  The front company generates revenue from sales of alcoholic beverages and cover \ncharges.  Patrons, however, also can obtain illicit sexual services from trafficked individuals, \nusually elsewhere in the establishment.12  In addition, illicit massage businesses or nail and hair \nsalons can offer sexual services under the guise of legitimate businesses and/or exploit individuals \nfor the purpose of forced labor.13  Often, these establishments will appear to be a single storefront, \nyet are part of a larger network.  Payments for these illicit services are usually in cash, and \ntraffickers may invest the illicit proceeds in high-value assets, such as real estate and cars.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n4\n2.  Exploitative Employment Practices \nSome seemingly legitimate businesses use exploitative employment schemes, such as visa fraud and \nwage retention, to amass profit from labor and sex trafficking.  For instance, some labor recruiters \nmislead or defraud victims, taking advantage of workers before and after they enter the United States.  \nSome labor recruiters also mislead workers about the conditions and nature of a job, engage in contract \nswitching, and confiscate or destroy workers’ identity documents.14  Foreign nationals who have \nlegitimate temporary work or student visas also can be exploited.15\nAnother common practice is to charge exploitative fees to workers by withholding their salary \nor paying less than promised.  The trafficker claims that the fees cover the costs of recruitment \nor access to job opportunities.16  Recruitment fees can range from hundreds of dollars to tens of \nthousands of dollars, and take years to repay.17  Victims’ salaries are transferred to the traffickers \nor their co-conspirators via teller checks or wire transfers.  Proceeds also can be “disguised” as a \nlegitimate business expense, such as a cleaning service.  Financial institutions may see multiple \nemployees receiving their salaries in the same account, or payment for employment may be \nfollowed by immediate withdrawal or transfer into another account.18\n3.  Funnel Accounts \nFunnel accounts generally involve an individual or business account in one geographic area \nthat receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, from \nwhich the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between \nthe deposits and withdrawals.19  Human traffickers may use interstate funnel accounts to transfer \nfunds between geographic areas, move proceeds rapidly, and maintain anonymity.20  In labor and \nsex trafficking schemes, human traffickers may open accounts in their name, or escort victims to \na bank, and force them to open an account.21  Traffickers maintain control of the victims’ bank \naccounts through coercion, and direct victims to deposit money into their accounts and other \naccounts that the traffickers can access.22  In some cases, victims also are coerced or forced to wire \nproceeds via money services businesses (MSBs) to facilitate the funneling of proceeds.   \n14.\t U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017); see also U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, “Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February \n25, 2016).\n15.\t U.S. Department of Justice, Journal of Federal Law and Practice, “Human Trafficking,” Executive Office of United \nStates Attorneys, pp. 5 and 28, (November 2017).\n16.\t For more information see U.S. Department of Justice, “Leader of Human Trafficking Organization Sentenced to Over \n15 Years for Exploiting Guatemalan Migrants at Ohio Egg Farms,” (June 27, 2016); and U.S. Department of Justice, \n“Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February 25, 2016).  \n17.\t See U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017).\n18.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 28, (July 2018).\n19.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A005, “Update on U.S. Currency Restrictions in Mexico: Funnel Accounts and TBML,” \np. 1, (May 28, 2014).  \n20.\t See U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking,” \n(January 29, 2015).\n21.\t For additional behavioral indicators of human trafficking, see Section II, infra.\n22.\t Policies of certain large national banks to restrict third-party cash deposits for private customer accounts seem to have \nlessened the use of funnel account activity.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n7\nFinancial Indicators \nTo help identify and report transactions possibly associated with human trafficking, FinCEN \nhas identified 10 new financial red flag indicators.

In 2023, Operation STORM MAKERS \nII, which was aimed at identifying and \ndismantling criminal organizations engaged \nin human trafficking and smuggling of \nmigrants, entailed a unique focus on the \ntrend of human trafficking for the purpose \nof online fraud in Southeast Asia and other \nimpacted regions.\n7  INTERPOL. Online Scams and Human Trafficking in South East Asia. 25 October 2022. Public Version. INTERPOL for Official Use Only. \n8 INTERPOL. Online scams and Human Trafficking in South East Asia / Update 2 – From Regional to Global Threat (PUBLIC Version). 06 July 2023. INTERPOL \nfor official use only.\nFinancial Fraud and Forced Criminality\nINTERPOL research and analysis brought to \nlight a trend involving human trafficking for the \npurpose of forced online fraud. This trend refers \nto a modus operandi involving, on the one hand, \nVictims (A) - those who are trafficked and forced to \nconduct online fraud in so-called scam call centres \nor compounds and, on the other hand, Victims \n(B) - those who are defrauded of large sums of \nmoney by the trafficked victims. In the framework \nof Operation STORM MAKERS I & II, INTERPOL’s \nHuman Trafficking and Smuggling of Migrants \n(HTSM) Unit identified large-scale, cyber-enabled \nhuman trafficking operations perpetrated by Asian \ncrime syndicates for the purpose of forced online \nfraud across several Southeast Asian countries7. \nWhilst originally, trafficked individuals were mostly \nChinese-speaking victims, as the trend spread, \nboth recruitment and defrauding strategies further \nevolved to include victims from across the world8. \nAlthough it is important to note that not all scam \ncentres depend on the use of forced criminality, \ninformation recently shared by member countries \nwith INTERPOL suggests that scam centres or \ncompounds that do exploit trafficked victims have \nbegun to emerge across the globe. In Latin America, \nINTERPOL member countries have reported the \nidentification of a similar modus operandi where \nVictims (A), who typically originate from the region, \nare recruited through fake job advertisements, \nsometimes in public spaces. Once in the compounds, \ntheir identity documents are taken and they are \nforced to commit online financial fraud, mostly in \nthe form of advance-payment fraud, telecom fraud \nand impersonation fraud. These schemes tend to \ninvolve relatively small sums of money (between \nUSD 100 and USD 500), but they are replicated on \na large-scale through social media platforms and \nonline marketplaces. The fact that small sums are \ninvolved often discourages victims from reporting \nthe fraud, which prevents the identification of the \ncriminal structures behind these fraud schemes.\nFurthermore, INTERPOL has been notified of the \nexistence of similar scam centres in African countries, \ntargeting not only individuals and businesses in the \nAfrican region, but also worldwide. \nRegarding Europe, and based on cases shared with \nINTERPOL, scam centres were reportedly active \nsince the 2010s in European countries among \nother member countries. Moreover, and although \nintelligence gaps remain, there are reports pointing \nat the existence of human trafficking-fuelled scam \ncentres in Eastern European countries, where local \ngroups are believed to be collaborating with foreign \ncriminal organizations. In these cases, Victims (A) \nare reportedly from the Middle East.  \nAs this modus operandi continues to expand and \nthe profiles of Victims (A) become more diversified, \nwith victims from Asia, Africa and Latin America \nbeing held in scam centres, it is highly likely that the \npool of targeted Victims (B) will further enlarge. In \naddition, the emergence of AI-generated content \nwill likely increase the reach, sophistication and \ncapacity of fraud schemes conducted through \ntrafficking-driven scam centres, resulting in the \nexpansion of fraud worldwide.\n12', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n8\nCase Studies\nFunnel Accounts Facilitate International Thai Sex Trafficking Ring \nIn December 2018, 36 defendants were found guilty in St. Paul, Minnesota, for their various \nroles in operating an international sex trafficking ring, i.e., traffickers, house bosses, money \nlaunderers, and facilitators.  Traffickers based in Thailand lured women to the United States \nthrough false promises of a better life.  To facilitate the transport of the victims, the organization \nengaged in visa fraud by creating false identification documents, and forced many of the \nvictims to enter into fraudulent marriages and debt bondage.  In exchange, each victim incurred \na debt of $55,000, which far exceeded actual expenses.  Once in the United States, the victims \nwere sent to various cities, isolated in a residence, and forced to pay off their debt by engaging \nin commercial sex acts.34\nTo conceal and redistribute the proceeds of the sex trafficking business, victims were forced \nto open U.S. bank accounts in Los Angeles in their own names.  Once an account was opened, \nhowever, traffickers based in the United States took control of the account, kept a percentage of \nthe cash generated, and sent the remainder back to the traffickers in Thailand.  Other members \nof the organization, the “facilitators,” rented the houses, apartments, and hotels, and facilitated \nthe transport of victims.\nThe organization used funnel accounts to launder money deposited in cities across the United \nStates to third-party launderers who made cash withdrawals in Los Angeles.35  According to data \nmade available to FinCEN, deposits were made in cash, and were just enough to cover account \ndebits.  To move funds to and from Thailand, the organization employed third-party money \nlaunderers who made bank accounts available and coordinated cash deposits and withdrawals.  \nBulk cash smuggling was another scheme used to physically transport proceeds to Thailand.  \nAccording to law enforcement, individuals were recruited to carry large volumes of cash in \nsuitcases and transport the money to Thailand.  To evade detection, the trafficking organization \npaid flight attendants to keep quiet, and in some limited instances, to transport bulk cash \nin their own luggage.  Money also was concealed in clothing and dolls that were shipped to \nThailand.  To date, law enforcement has recovered $1.5 million in cash, and testimony revealed \nthat more than $40 million was sent to Thailand by one money launderer alone.  \n34.\t For information on this case, see U.S. Department of Justice, “Twenty-One Additional Defendants Indicted for their \nRoles in Thai Sex Trafficking Enterprise,” (May 25, 2017); see also U.S. Department of Justice, “Thirty-Six Defendants \nGuilty for their Roles in International Thai Sex Trafficking Organization,” (December 13, 2018).\n35.\t For a definition of third-party money launderers see U.S. Department of Homeland Security, “Third Party Money \nLaunderers,” (Summer 2017).', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n11\nFinancial institutions that suspect human trafficking activity should also mark the check box \nfor human trafficking (SAR Field 38(h)) on the SAR form.  \nFor Further Information\nQuestions or comments regarding the contents of this advisory should be addressed to the FinCEN \nRegulatory Support Section at frc@fincen.gov.\nThe mission of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is to safeguard \nthe financial system from illicit use, combat money laundering and its \nrelated crimes including terrorism, and promote national security through \nthe strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and \ndissemination of financial intelligence.', '23\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\nSAR Activity Review — Trends, Tips & Issues (Issue 22)\nproduct received from these companies;\n2\n2 Unusual withdrawal, deposit or wire activity inconsistent with normal business \npractices, or dramatic and unexplained change in account activity;\n2\n2 Sudden change in customer’s normal business practices, i.e., dramatic increase \nin deposits, withdrawals or wealth;\n2\n2 Structuring financial transactions at money service businesses (MSBs) (multiple \nfinancial transactions structured under the $3,000 MSB’s reporting limit on the \nsame day); and\n2\n2 Numerous incoming wire transfers or personal checks deposited into business \naccounts with no apparent legitimate purpose.\nThe success of Project STAMP is integral to our mission of protecting the homeland \nby shutting down criminal organizations that seek to exploit individuals through \nsmuggling or trafficking schemes.

"How do the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of the Treasury contribute to combating human trafficking, particularly regarding goods produced by forced or child labor and financial crimes?","The U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of the Treasury play significant roles in combating human trafficking, particularly in relation to goods produced by forced or child labor and financial crimes associated with trafficking. Here's how each department contributes:

### U.S. Department of Labor

1. **List of Goods Produced by Forced or Child Labor**: The Department of Labor maintains a list of goods and their source countries that are believed to be produced by forced or child labor. This list is crucial for identifying and targeting products that violate international labor standards, thereby helping to prevent such goods from entering the U.S. market.

2. **Awareness and Compliance**: By maintaining and publicizing this list, the Department of Labor raises awareness among businesses and consumers about the origins of certain goods. This encourages companies to ensure their supply chains are free from forced or child labor, promoting compliance with international labor standards.

### U.S. Department of the Treasury

1. **Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)**: The Treasury Department, through FinCEN, plays a critical role in identifying and combating financial crimes related to human trafficking. FinCEN issues advisories and provides guidance to financial institutions on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities that may be linked to human trafficking.

2. **Money Laundering and Financial Indicators**: Human trafficking is often linked to money laundering. The Treasury Department identifies financial red flags and typologies that indicate potential human trafficking activities. These include unusual financial transactions, use of funnel accounts, and transactions involving prepaid cards and virtual currencies.

3. **Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)**: Financial institutions are required to file SARs when they detect suspicious transactions that may be related to human trafficking. The Treasury Department provides guidance on how to complete these reports, ensuring that law enforcement agencies receive the necessary information to investigate and prosecute trafficking-related financial crimes.

4. **Project STAMP**: This initiative by the Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the Treasury, targets the illicit proceeds of human smuggling and trafficking organizations. It focuses on identifying and seizing assets derived from or used in support of trafficking activities, thereby disrupting the financial infrastructure of these criminal networks.

5. **Collaboration with Law Enforcement**: The Treasury Department works closely with law enforcement agencies to track and dismantle the financial networks that support human trafficking. This includes sharing intelligence and coordinating efforts to seize assets and prosecute offenders.

### Conclusion

Together, the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of the Treasury address human trafficking from both a labor and financial perspective. The Department of Labor focuses on preventing goods produced by forced or child labor from entering the U.S. market, while the Treasury Department targets the financial aspects of trafficking, including money laundering and the movement of illicit funds. Through these efforts, both departments contribute to a comprehensive strategy to combat human trafficking and protect vulnerable populations.","['imported into the United States.

Alternative Payment Methods \nIn addition to payment via cash, traffickers also have accepted payment via credit cards, prepaid \ncards,23 mobile payment applications, and convertible virtual currency.24  Buyers of commercial \nsex use prepaid cards—a method of payment using funds paid in advance, which can be acquired \nanonymously with cash or on darknet websites—to register with escort websites and to purchase \nsexual services, flights, throw-away phones, and hotel rooms.25\nIllicit actors also use virtual currency to advertise commercial sex online.  For example, human \ntraffickers have purchased prepaid cards, and then used the cards to purchase virtual currency on \na peer-to-peer exchange platform.  Human traffickers then use the virtual currency to buy online \nadvertisements that feature commercial sex acts to obtain customers.26\nFinCEN also has identified transactions in which human traffickers use third-party payment \nprocessors (TPPPs) to wire funds, which gives the appearance that the TPPP is the originator or \nbeneficiary of the wire transfer and conceals the true originator or beneficiary.  For example, human \ntraffickers facilitate payments via TPPPs for the operation of online escort services and online \nstreaming services that use voice-over Internet protocol technology.  Human traffickers and their \nfacilitators use TPPPs to wire funds to individuals or businesses both domestically and abroad.27\nCase Study: Trafficking Involving Prepaid Cards and Bitcoin\nII.  Behavioral and Financial Red Flag Indicators \nof Human Trafficking\nIn applying the red flags below and the red flags in the 2014 Advisory, financial institutions are \nadvised that no single red flag is a clear indicator of human trafficking activity, although each can \nbe indicative of forced labor and/or sex trafficking.  Given that human trafficking is a predicate \noffense to money laundering, the financial red flags also may be indicative of other money \nlaundering-related offenses.  Financial institutions should consider additional factors, such as \na customer’s previous financial activity and the existence of typologies or other red flags, when \ndetermining whether transactions may be associated with human trafficking.  \n23.\t See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “National Money Laundering Risk Assessment,” p. 15-16, (2018).\n24.\t For more information about illicit activity involving convertible virtual currency see FinCEN Advisory, \nFIN-2019-A003, “Advisory on Illicit Activity Involving Convertible Virtual Currency,” (May 9, 2019).\n25.\t See New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s testimony, “Following the Money: How Human Traffickers \nExploit the U.S. Financial Markets: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the \nCommittee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives,” (January 30, 2018).

The only outside contact they may have is when visiting financial institutions such as \nbank branches, check cashing counters, or money wiring services.  Consequently, it is important that \ncustomer-facing staff consider the following behavioral indicators when conducting transactions,28 \nparticularly those that also present financial indicators of human trafficking schemes discussed \nbelow.  As appropriate, such information should be incorporated into Suspicious Activity Report \n(SAR) filings and/or reported to law enforcement.29  When incorporated into SAR filings, it is \nimportant that behavioral indicators, and the staff who witnessed them, are included in the SAR \nnarrative so that information may be effectively searched for, and later used by, law enforcement.  \nThis list is not exhaustive and is only a selection of behavioral indicators:30\n\tA third party speaks on behalf of the customer (a third party may insist on being present and/\nor translating).\n\tA third party insists on being present for every aspect of the transaction.  \n\tA third party attempts to fill out paperwork without consulting the customer.\n\tA third party maintains possession and/or control of all documents or money.\n\tA third party claims to be related to the customer, but does not know critical details.\n\tA prospective customer uses, or attempts to use, third-party identification (of someone who is \nnot present) to open an account.  \n\tA third party attempts to open an account for an unqualified minor.\n\tA third party commits acts of physical aggression or intimidation toward the customer.  \n\tA customer shows signs of poor hygiene, malnourishment, fatigue, signs of physical and/or \nsexual abuse, physical restraint, confinement, or torture.\n\tA customer shows lack of knowledge of their whereabouts, cannot clarify where they live or \nwhere they are staying, or provides scripted, confusing, or inconsistent stories in response to \ninquiry.\n28.\t Additional resources discussing human trafficking and the role of financial institutions include the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security, Blue Campaign, “Resources Page”; U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Combatting Human \nTrafficking,” (January, 29, 2020); U.S. Department of State, “Tracking Suspicious Financial Activity to Address Human \nTrafficking,” (June 28, 2018); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to \nCombat Human Trafficking,” (January 29, 2015); and Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human \nTrafficking,” (July 2018).  \n29.\t To report suspicious activity indicative of human trafficking to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line, call 1-866-DHS-2-ICE (1-866-347-2423) 24 hours a day, seven days a \nweek, every day of the year.

Exploitative Employment Practices \nSome seemingly legitimate businesses use exploitative employment schemes, such as visa fraud and \nwage retention, to amass profit from labor and sex trafficking.  For instance, some labor recruiters \nmislead or defraud victims, taking advantage of workers before and after they enter the United States.  \nSome labor recruiters also mislead workers about the conditions and nature of a job, engage in contract \nswitching, and confiscate or destroy workers’ identity documents.14  Foreign nationals who have \nlegitimate temporary work or student visas also can be exploited.15\nAnother common practice is to charge exploitative fees to workers by withholding their salary \nor paying less than promised.  The trafficker claims that the fees cover the costs of recruitment \nor access to job opportunities.16  Recruitment fees can range from hundreds of dollars to tens of \nthousands of dollars, and take years to repay.17  Victims’ salaries are transferred to the traffickers \nor their co-conspirators via teller checks or wire transfers.  Proceeds also can be “disguised” as a \nlegitimate business expense, such as a cleaning service.  Financial institutions may see multiple \nemployees receiving their salaries in the same account, or payment for employment may be \nfollowed by immediate withdrawal or transfer into another account.18\n3.  Funnel Accounts \nFunnel accounts generally involve an individual or business account in one geographic area \nthat receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, from \nwhich the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between \nthe deposits and withdrawals.19  Human traffickers may use interstate funnel accounts to transfer \nfunds between geographic areas, move proceeds rapidly, and maintain anonymity.20  In labor and \nsex trafficking schemes, human traffickers may open accounts in their name, or escort victims to \na bank, and force them to open an account.21  Traffickers maintain control of the victims’ bank \naccounts through coercion, and direct victims to deposit money into their accounts and other \naccounts that the traffickers can access.22  In some cases, victims also are coerced or forced to wire \nproceeds via money services businesses (MSBs) to facilitate the funneling of proceeds.   \n14.\t U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017); see also U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, “Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February \n25, 2016).\n15.\t U.S. Department of Justice, Journal of Federal Law and Practice, “Human Trafficking,” Executive Office of United \nStates Attorneys, pp. 5 and 28, (November 2017).\n16.\t For more information see U.S. Department of Justice, “Leader of Human Trafficking Organization Sentenced to Over \n15 Years for Exploiting Guatemalan Migrants at Ohio Egg Farms,” (June 27, 2016); and U.S. Department of Justice, \n“Brothers Sentenced to 20 Years for Running Violent Human Trafficking Enterprise,” (February 25, 2016).  \n17.\t See U.S. Department of State, “Paying to Work: The High Cost of Recruitment Fees,” (June 27, 2017).\n18.\t Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 28, (July 2018).\n19.\t FinCEN Advisory, FIN-2014-A005, “Update on U.S. Currency Restrictions in Mexico: Funnel Accounts and TBML,” \np. 1, (May 28, 2014).  \n20.\t See U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “Using a Financial Attack Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking,” \n(January 29, 2015).\n21.\t For additional behavioral indicators of human trafficking, see Section II, infra.\n22.\t Policies of certain large national banks to restrict third-party cash deposits for private customer accounts seem to have \nlessened the use of funnel account activity.', 'F I N C E N  A D V I S O R Y\n3\nIn contrast to human smuggling, human trafficking does not require movement.  Human \ntraffickers can exploit individuals within the border of a country, and even in a victim’s own \nhome.  Human trafficking can also begin as human smuggling, as individuals who enter a \ncountry voluntarily and illegally are inherently vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and often \nowe a large debt to their smuggler.10\nBecause the information financial institutions collect and report is vital to identifying human \ntrafficking and stopping the growth of this crime, it is imperative that financial institutions \nenable their detection and reporting of suspicious transactions by becoming aware of the current \nmethodologies that traffickers and facilitators use.  It is also critical that customer-facing staff are \naware of behavioral indicators that may indicate human trafficking, as the only outside contact for \nvictims of human trafficking may occur when visiting financial institutions.\n10.\t See U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, “Human Trafficking vs Human Smuggling,” (Summer 2017); and \nsee also U.S. Department of State, “Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling: Understanding the Difference,” (June \n27, 2017).\n11.\t An establishment that provides food, drinks, dancing, and music, and is typically found in Latin American \ncommunities.   \n12.\t See Financial Action Task Force, “Financial Flows from Human Trafficking,” p. 54 (July 2018).

New Typologies of Human Trafficking \nTo evade detection, hide their illicit proceeds, and profit off the backs of victims, human traffickers \nemploy a variety of evolving techniques.  Below are four typologies, identified in Bank Secrecy Act \n(BSA) data since FinCEN issued the 2014 Advisory, that human traffickers and facilitators have \nused to launder money.  \n1.  Front Companies \nHuman traffickers routinely establish and use front companies, sometimes legal entities, to hide \nthe true nature of a business, and its illicit activities, owners, and associates.  Front companies are \nbusinesses that combine illicit proceeds with those gained from legitimate business operations.  \nExamples of front companies used by human traffickers for labor or sex trafficking include massage \nbusinesses, escort services, bars, restaurants, and cantinas.11  In the case of businesses that act as \na front for human trafficking, typically the establishment appears legitimate with registrations \nand licenses.  The front company generates revenue from sales of alcoholic beverages and cover \ncharges.  Patrons, however, also can obtain illicit sexual services from trafficked individuals, \nusually elsewhere in the establishment.12  In addition, illicit massage businesses or nail and hair \nsalons can offer sexual services under the guise of legitimate businesses and/or exploit individuals \nfor the purpose of forced labor.13  Often, these establishments will appear to be a single storefront, \nyet are part of a larger network.  Payments for these illicit services are usually in cash, and \ntraffickers may invest the illicit proceeds in high-value assets, such as real estate and cars.', '1\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \n(FinCEN) is issuing this advisory to help save lives, \nand to protect the most vulnerable in our society \nfrom predators and cowards who prey on the \ninnocent and defenseless for money and greed.

These transactions can be combined with travel and \ntransactions in and to foreign countries that are significant conduits for human trafficking.33\n\tTransactions are inconsistent with a customer’s expected activity and/or line of business in \nan apparent effort to cover trafficking victims’ living costs, including housing (e.g., hotel, \nmotel, short-term rentals, or residential accommodations), transportation (e.g., airplane, taxi, \nlimousine, or rideshare services), medical expenses, pharmacies, clothing, grocery stores, and \nrestaurants, to include fast food eateries.   \n\tTransactional activity largely occurs outside of normal business operating hours (e.g., an \nestablishment that operates during the day has a large number of transactions at night), is \nalmost always made in cash, and deposits are larger than what is expected for the business \nand the size of its operations.  \n\tA customer frequently makes cash deposits with no Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments. \n\tAn individual frequently purchases and uses prepaid access cards.  \n\tA customer’s account shares common identifiers, such as a telephone number, email, and \nsocial media handle, or address, associated with escort agency websites and commercial sex \nadvertisements.\n\tFrequent transactions with online classified sites that are based in foreign jurisdictions.  \n\tA customer frequently sends or receives funds via cryptocurrency to or from darknet markets \nor services known to be associated with illicit activity.

Traffickers based in Thailand lured women to the United States \nthrough false promises of a better life.  To facilitate the transport of the victims, the organization \nengaged in visa fraud by creating false identification documents, and forced many of the \nvictims to enter into fraudulent marriages and debt bondage.  In exchange, each victim incurred \na debt of $55,000, which far exceeded actual expenses.  Once in the United States, the victims \nwere sent to various cities, isolated in a residence, and forced to pay off their debt by engaging \nin commercial sex acts.34\nTo conceal and redistribute the proceeds of the sex trafficking business, victims were forced \nto open U.S. bank accounts in Los Angeles in their own names.  Once an account was opened, \nhowever, traffickers based in the United States took control of the account, kept a percentage of \nthe cash generated, and sent the remainder back to the traffickers in Thailand.  Other members \nof the organization, the “facilitators,” rented the houses, apartments, and hotels, and facilitated \nthe transport of victims.\nThe organization used funnel accounts to launder money deposited in cities across the United \nStates to third-party launderers who made cash withdrawals in Los Angeles.35  According to data \nmade available to FinCEN, deposits were made in cash, and were just enough to cover account \ndebits.  To move funds to and from Thailand, the organization employed third-party money \nlaunderers who made bank accounts available and coordinated cash deposits and withdrawals.  \nBulk cash smuggling was another scheme used to physically transport proceeds to Thailand.  \nAccording to law enforcement, individuals were recruited to carry large volumes of cash in \nsuitcases and transport the money to Thailand.  To evade detection, the trafficking organization \npaid flight attendants to keep quiet, and in some limited instances, to transport bulk cash \nin their own luggage.  Money also was concealed in clothing and dolls that were shipped to \nThailand.  To date, law enforcement has recovered $1.5 million in cash, and testimony revealed \nthat more than $40 million was sent to Thailand by one money launderer alone.  \n34.\t For information on this case, see U.S. Department of Justice, “Twenty-One Additional Defendants Indicted for their \nRoles in Thai Sex Trafficking Enterprise,” (May 25, 2017); see also U.S. Department of Justice, “Thirty-Six Defendants \nGuilty for their Roles in International Thai Sex Trafficking Organization,” (December 13, 2018).\n35.\t For a definition of third-party money launderers see U.S. Department of Homeland Security, “Third Party Money \nLaunderers,” (Summer 2017).', 'Introduction \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n3 \n2/27/2015.V2 \nBackground \nIn 1970, Congress passed the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act commonly \nknown as the Bank Secrecy Act,2 which established requirements for record keeping and \nreporting by private individuals, banks,3 and other financial institutions.  The BSA was \ndesigned to help identify the source, volume, and movement of currency and other monetary \ninstruments transported or transmitted into or out of the United States or deposited in \nfinancial institutions.  The statute sought to achieve that objective by requiring individuals, \nbanks, and other financial institutions to file currency reports with the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury (U.S. Treasury), properly identify persons conducting transactions, and maintain a \npaper trail by keeping appropriate records of financial transactions.  These records enable law \nenforcement and regulatory agencies to pursue investigations of criminal, tax, and regulatory \nviolations, if warranted, and provide evidence useful in prosecuting money laundering and \nother financial crimes. \nThe Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 augmented the BSA’s effectiveness by adding \nthe interrelated sections 8(s) and 21 to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) and section \n206(q) of the Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA), which sections apply equally to banks of all \ncharters.4 The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 precludes circumvention of the BSA \nrequirements by imposing criminal liability on a person or financial institution that \nknowingly assists in the laundering of money, or that structures transactions to avoid \nreporting them.  The 1986 statute directed banks to establish and maintain procedures \nreasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the reporting and recordkeeping \nrequirements of the BSA.  As a result, on January 27, 1987, all federal banking agencies \nissued essentially similar regulations requiring banks to develop programs for BSA \ncompliance. \nThe 1992 Annunzio–Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act strengthened the sanctions for BSA \nviolations and the role of the U.S. Treasury.  Two years later, Congress passed the Money \nLaundering Suppression Act of 1994 (MLSA), which further addressed the U.S. Treasury’s \nrole in combating money laundering. \nIn April 1996, a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) was developed to be used by all banking \norganizations in the United States.  A banking organization is required to file a SAR \nwhenever it detects a known or suspected criminal violation of federal law or a suspicious \ntransaction related to money laundering activity or a violation of the BSA. \nIn response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress passed the Uniting and \nStrengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct \nTerrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act).  Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act is the \n2 31 USC 5311 et seq., 12 USC 1829b, and 1951 – 1959.  Also refer to 12 USC 1818(s) (federally insured \ndepository institutions) and 12 USC 1786(q) (federally insured credit unions). \n3 Under the BSA, as implemented by 31 CFR 1010.100 (formerly 31 CFR 103.11), the term “bank” includes \neach agent, agency, branch, or office within the United States of commercial banks, savings and loan \nassociations, thrift institutions, credit unions, and foreign banks.  The term “bank” is used throughout the \nmanual generically to refer to the financial institution being examined. \n4 12 USC 1818(s), 12 USC 1829(b), and 12 USC 1786(q), respectively.', 'BSA/AML Risk Assessment — Overview \nFFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual \n21 \n2/27/2015.V2 \n•\nNonresident alien (NRA)20 and accounts of foreign individuals.\n•\nForeign corporations and domestic business entities, particularly offshore corporations\n(such as domestic shell companies and Private Investment Companies (PIC) and\ninternational business corporations (IBC))21 located in higher-risk geographic locations.\n•\nDeposit brokers, particularly foreign deposit brokers.\n•\nCash-intensive businesses (e.g., convenience stores, restaurants, retail stores, liquor\nstores, cigarette distributors, privately owned ATMs, vending machine operators, and\nparking garages).\n•\nNongovernmental organizations and charities (foreign and domestic).\n•\nProfessional service providers (e.g., attorneys, accountants, doctors, or real estate\nbrokers).\nGeographic Locations \nIdentifying geographic locations that may pose a higher risk is essential to a bank’s \nBSA/AML compliance program.

This helps identify and restrict the importation of such goods into the United States. The U.S. Department of the Treasury addresses human trafficking by focusing on financial crimes, such as money laundering, that are associated with trafficking activities. Transactions involving proceeds from human trafficking can lead to federal criminal charges and asset forfeiture, as these crimes are considered specified unlawful activities for money laundering. Both departments play key roles in identifying, reporting, and restricting activities related to human trafficking.","['<1-hop>\n\nF I N C E N A D V I S O R Y 2 traffickers target those most impacted and vulnerable.4 Other effects of the pandemic (e.g., travel limitations, shelter-in-place orders, teleworking) also may affect the typologies and red flag indicators provided below. Unfortunately, in addition to the horrific toll on victims and their families, their very lives, dignity, and livelihood, human trafficking is now one of the most profitable and violent forms of international crime, generating an estimated $150 billion worldwide per year.5 In the United States, human trafficking now occurs in a broad range of licit and illicit industries (e.g., hospitality, agricultural, janitorial services, construction, restaurants, care for persons with disabilities, salon services, massage parlors, retail, fairs and carnivals, peddling and begging, child care, domestic work, and drug smuggling and distribution).6 Transactions involving proceeds generated by human trafficking can be the basis for federal criminal charges and asset forfeiture, as human trafficking and associated crimes constitute specified unlawful activities (SUAs) for the crime of money laundering.7 Since the 2014 Advisory, FinCEN collaborated with law enforcement to identify 20 new financial and behavioral indicators of labor and sex trafficking, and four additional typologies. This advisory provides: (i) new information to assist in identifying and reporting human trafficking, and to aid the global effort to combat this crime; and (ii) two illustrative recent case studies. The 2014 Advisory remains relevant, and provides information related to human smuggling, in addition to human trafficking. 4.
