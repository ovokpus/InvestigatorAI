Introduction  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  1 2/27/2015.V2  INTRODUCTION 
This Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Bank Secrecy Act 
(BSA)/Anti -Money Laundering (AML) Examination Manual  provides guidance to examiners 
for carrying out BSA/AML and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) examinations.  An 
effective BSA/AML compliance program requires sound risk management; therefore, the manual also provides guidance on identifying and controlling risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing.  The manual contains an overview of BSA/AML compliance program requirements, BSA/AML risks and risk management expectations, industry sound practices, and examination procedures.  The development of this manual was a collaborative effort of the federal  and state banking agencies
1 and the Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, to ensure consistency in the application of the BSA/AML requirements.  In addition, OFAC assisted in the development of the sections of the manual that relate to OFAC reviews.  For more guidance, r efer to  Appendix A ( “BSA Laws and Regulations ”), Appendix B ( “BSA/AML 
Directives ”), and Appendix C (“BSA/AML References ”). 
Structure of Manual  
In order to effectively apply resources and ensure compliance with BSA requirements, the manual is structured to allow examiners to tailor the BSA/AML examination scope and procedures to the specific risk profile of the banking organization.  The manual consists of 
the following sections: 
•Introduction.
•Core Examination Overview and Procedures for Assessing the BSA/AML Compliance
Program.
•Core Examination Overview and Procedur es for Regulatory Requirements and Related
Topics.
•Expanded Examination Overview and Procedures for Consolidated and Other Types ofBSA/AML  Compliance Program Structures.
•Expanded Examination Overview and Procedures for Products and Services.
•Expanded Examination Overview and Procedures for Persons and Entities.
•Appendix es.
The core and expanded overview sections provide narrative guidance and background information on each topic; each overview is followed by examination procedures.  The “Core 
1 The FFIEC was established in March 1979 to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms and to 
promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions.  The Council has six voting members: the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit I nsurance Corporation, the National Credit 
Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the State Liaison Committee.  The Council’s activities are supported by interagency task forces and  
by an advisory State Liaison Committee, comp osed of five representatives of state agencies that supervise 
financial institutions.

Introduction  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  2 2/27/2015.V2  Examination O verview and Procedures for Assessing the BSA/AML Compliance Program” 
and the “Core Examination Overview and Procedures for Regulatory Requirements and 
Related Topics” (core) sections serve as a platform for the BSA/AML examination and, for 
the most part, address legal and regulatory requirements of the BSA/AML compliance program.  The “Scoping and Planning” and the “BSA/AML Risk Assessment” sections help the examiner develop an appropriate examination plan based on the risk profile of the bank.  There may b e instances where a topic is covered in both the core and expanded sections (e.g., 
funds transfers and foreign correspondent banking).  In such instances, the core overview and examination procedures address the BSA requirements while the expanded overview and 
examination procedures address the AML risks of the specific activity.  
At a minimum, examiners should use the following examination procedures included within 
the “Core Examination Overview and Procedures for Assessing the BSA/AML Compliance Program” section of this manual to ensure that the bank has an adequate BSA/AML 
compliance program commensurate with its risk profile: 
•Scoping and Planning (refer to  page 11).
•BSA/AML Risk Assessment ( refer to  page 18).
•BSA/AML Compliance Program ( refer to  page  28).
•Developing Conclusions and Finalizing the Examination ( refer to  page 40).
While OFAC regulations are not part of the BSA, the core sections include overview and 
examination procedures for examining a bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for 
ensuring compliance with OFAC sanctions.  As part of the scoping and planning procedures, 
examiners must  review the bank’s OFAC risk assessment and independent testing to 
determine the extent to which a review of the bank’s OFAC compliance program should be 
conducted during the examination.  Refer to core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign 
Assets Control,” page  152, for further guidance. 
The expanded sections address specific lines of business, products, customers, or entities that may present unique challenges and exposures for which banks should institute appropriate policies, procedures, and processes.  Absent appropriate controls, these lines of business, products, customers, or entities could elevate BSA/AML risks.  In addition, the expanded 
section provides guidance on BSA/AML compliance program structures and management.  
Not all of the core and expanded examination procedures are  likely to be applicable to every 
banking organization.  The specific examination procedures that need to be performed 
depend on the BSA/AML risk profile of the banking organization, the quality and quantity of 
independent testing, the financial institution’s history of BSA/AML compliance, and other 
relevant factors.

Introduction  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  3 2/27/2015.V2  Background  
In 1970, Congress passed the Currency and Foreign Transactions Rep orting Act commonly 
known as the Bank Secrecy Act,2 which established requirements for record keeping and 
reporting by private individuals, banks,3 and other financial institutions.  The BSA was 
designed to help identify the source, volume, and movement of currency and other monetary 
instruments transported or transmitted into or out of the United States or deposited in financial institutions .  The statute sought to achieve that objective by requiring individuals, 
banks, and other fi nancial institutions to  file currency reports with the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury (U.S. Treasury), properly identify persons conducting transactions, and maintain a paper trail by keeping appropriate records of financial transactions .  These records enable law 
enforcement and regulatory agencies to pursue investigations of criminal, tax, and regulatory violations, if warranted, and provide evidence useful in prosecuting money laundering and 
other financial crimes.  
The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 augmented the BSA’ s effectiveness by adding 
the interrelated sections 8(s) and 21 to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ( FDIA) and section 
206(q) of the Federal Credit Union Act  (FCUA ), which sections apply equally to banks of all 
charters.
4 The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 precludes circumvention of the BSA 
requirements by imposing criminal liability on a person or financial institution that 
knowingly assists in the laundering of money, or that structures transactions to avoid reporting them.  The 1986 statute directed banks to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the BSA .  As a result, on January 27, 1987, all federal banking agencies 
issued essentially similar regulations requiring banks to develop programs for BSA 
compliance.  
The 1992 Annunzio–Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act strengthened the sanctions for BSA 
violations and the role of the U.S. Treasury.  Two years later, Congress passed the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 (MLSA), which further addressed the U.S. Treasury’ s 
role in combating money laundering. 
In April 1996, a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) was developed to be used by all banking 
organizations in the United States.  A banking organization is required to file a SAR whenever it detects a known or suspected criminal violation of federal law or a suspicious 
transaction related to money laundering activity or a violation of the BSA. 
In response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress passed the Uniting and 
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 ( USA PATRIOT Act ).  Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act is the 
2 31 USC 5311 et seq., 12 USC 1829b, and 1951 – 1959.  Also refer to 12 USC 1818(s) (federally insured 
depository institutions) and 12 USC 1786(q) (federally insured credit unions).  
3 Under the BSA, as implemented by 31 CFR 1010.100 (formerly 31 CFR 103.11) , the term “bank” includes 
each agent, agency, branch, or office within the United States of commercial banks, sa vings and loan 
associations, thrift institutions, credit unions, and foreign banks.  The term “bank” is used throughout the 
manual generically to refer to the financial institution being examined.  
4 12 USC 1818(s), 12 USC 1829(b), and 12 USC 1786(q), respe ctively.

Introduction  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  4 2/27/2015.V2  International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti -Terrorist Financing Act of 2001.  The 
USA PATRIOT  Act is arguably the single most significant AML law that Congress has 
enacted since the BSA itself .  Among other things, the USA PATRIOT  Act criminalized the 
financing of terrorism and augmen ted the existing BSA framework by strengthening 
customer identification procedures; prohibiting financial institutions from engaging in 
business with foreign shell banks; requiring financial institutions to have due diligence procedures and, in some cases, enhanced due diligence ( EDD) procedures for foreign 
correspondent and private banking accounts; and improving information sharing between financial institutions and the U.S. government.  The USA PATRIOT  Act and its 
implementing regulations also: 
•Expanded the AML program requirements to all financial institutions.
5 Refer to
Appendix D (“ Statutory Definition of Financial Institution ”) for further clarification.
•Increased the civil and criminal penalties for money laundering.
•Provided the Secretary of the Treasury with the authority to impose “special measures ”
on jurisdictions, institutions, or transactions that are of “ primary money -laundering
concern. ”
•Facilitated records access and required banks to respond to regulatory requests for
information within 120 hours.
•Required federal banking agencies to consider a bank ’s AML record when reviewing
bank mergers, acquisitions, and other applications for business combinations.
Role of Government Agencies in the BSA  
Certain government agencies play a critical role i n implementing BSA regulations, 
developing examination guidance, ensuring compliance with the BSA, and enforcing the BSA .  These agencies include the U.S. Treasury, FinCEN, and the federal banking agencies 
(Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) , National Credit Union Administration  (NCUA) , and Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC ).  Internationally there are various multilateral 
government bodies that support the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.  
Refer to  Appendix E (“International Organizations”) for additional information. 
U.S. Treasury  
The BSA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to require financial institutions to establish 
AML programs, file certain reports, and keep certain records of transactions .  Certain BSA 
provisions have been extended to cover not only traditional depository institutions, such as banks, savings associations, and credit unions, but also nonbank financial institutions, such as 
5 The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the AML program requirement to all financial institutions as that term is 
defined in 31 USC 5312(a)(2).  However, as of the publication of this manual, only certain types of financial 
institutions are subject to fina l rules implementing the AML program requirements of 31 USC 5318(h)(1) as 
established by the USA PATRIOT Act.  Those financial institutions that are not currently subject to a final 
AML program rule are temporarily exempted from the USA PATRIOT Act require ments to establish an AML 
program, as set forth in 31 CFR 1010.205 (formerly 31 CFR 103.170) .

merchants , mutual funds , insurance companies, and operators of credit card systems.  
FinCEN 
FinCEN , a bureau of the U.S. Treasury, is the delegated administrator of the BSA .  In this 
capacity, FinCEN issues regulations and interpretive guidance, provides outreach to 
regulated industries, supports the examination functions performed by federal banking agencies, and pursues civil enforcement actions when warranted .  FinCEN relies on the 
federal banking agencies to examine banks within their respective jurisdictions for compliance with the BSA .  FinCEN ’s other significant responsibilities include providing 
investigative case support to law enforcement, identifying and communicating financial crime trends and patterns, and fostering international cooperation with its counterparts 
worldwide. 
Federal Banking Agencies  
The federal banking agencies are responsible for the oversight of the various banking entities 
operating  in the United States, including foreign branch offices of U.S. banks.  The federal 
banking agencies are charged with chartering ( NCUA and OCC ), insuring ( FDIC  and 
NCUA), regulating, and supervising banks.6 12 USC 1818(s)(2) and 1786(q) require that the 
appropriate federal banking agency include a review of the BSA compliance program at each examination of an insured depository institution.  The federal banking agencies may use their authori ty, as granted  under section 8 of the FDIA  or section 206 of the FCUA, to enforce 
compliance with  appropriate banking rules and regulations, including compliance with the 
BSA.  
The federal banking agencies require each bank under their supervision to establish and maintain a BSA compliance program.
7 In accordance with the USA PATRIOT  Act, 
FinCEN ’s regulations require certain financial institutions to establish an AML compliance 
program that guards against money laundering and terrorist financing and ensures compliance with the BSA and its implementing  regulations.  When the USA PATRIOT  Act 
was passed, banks under the supervision of a federal banking agency were already required by law to establish and maintain a BSA compliance program that, among other things, requires the bank to identify and report suspicious activity promptly.  For this reason, 31 CFR  1020.210 states that a bank regulated by a federal banking agency is deemed to have 
satisfied the AML program requirements of the USA PATRIOT  Act if the bank develops and 
maintains a BSA compliance prog ram that complies with the regulation of its federal 
functional regulator
8 governing such programs.  This manual refer s to the BSA compliance 
program requirements for each federal banking agency as the “BSA/AML compliance 
program.” 
6 The Federal Reserve and FDIC  may collaborate with state banking agencies on the examination, oversight, 
and enforcement of BSA/AML for state -chartered banks.  
7 Refer to 12 CFR 208.63, 12 CFR 211.5(m) and 12 CFR 211.24(j) (Federal Reserve); 12 CFR 326.8 ( FDIC ); 
12 CFR 748.2 ( NCUA ); 12 CFR 21.21( OCC).  
8 Federal functional regulator means: Federal Reserve, FDIC,  NCUA,  OCC,  Securities and Exchange 
Commission or U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Introduction  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  6 2/27/2015.V2  Banks should take reasonable and prudent steps to combat money laundering and terrorist 
financing and to minimize their vulnerability to the risk associated with such activities .  
Some banking organizations have damaged their reputations and have been required to pay civil money penalties for failing to implement adequate controls within their organization resulting in noncompliance with the BSA.  In addition, due to the AML assessment required as part of the application process, BSA/AML concerns can have an impact on the bank’ s 
strategic plan .  For this reason, the federal banking agencies’ and FinCEN ’s commitment to 
provide guidance that assists banks in complying with the BSA remains a high supervisory 
priority.  
The federal banking agencies work to ensure that the organizations they supervise understand 
the importance of having an effective BSA/AML compliance program in place.  Management must be vigilant in this area, especially as business grows and new products and services are introduced .  An evaluation of the bank’ s BSA/AML compliance program and its 
compliance with the regulatory requirements of the BSA has been an integral part of the supervision process for years.  Refer to  Appendix A ( “BSA Laws and Regulations” ) for 
further information. 
As part of a strong BSA/AML compliance program, the federal banking agencies seek to 
ensure that a bank has policies, procedures, and processes to identify and report suspicious 
transactions to law enforcement .  The agencies ’ supervisory processes assess whether banks 
have established the appropriate policies, procedures, and processes based on their 
BSA/AML risk to identify and report suspicious activity and that they provide sufficient detail in reports to law enforcement agencies to make the reports useful for investigating suspicious tra nsactions that are reported .  Refer to Appendix es B ( “BSA/AML Directives ”) 
and C (“ BSA/AML References ”) for guidance.  
On July 19, 2007, the federal banking agencies issued a statement setting forth the agencies’ policy for enforcing specific anti-money laundering requirements of the BSA.  The purpose of the Interagency Statement on Enforcement of Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Requirements  (Interagency Enforcement Statement)  is to provide greater consistency among 
the agencies in enforcement decisio ns in BSA matters and to offer insight into the 
considerations that form the basis of those decisions.

OFAC  
OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries, terrorists, international 
narcotics traffickers, and those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  OFAC acts under the President ’s wartime and national emergency powers, 
as well as under authority granted by specific legislation, to impose controls on transactions and freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction.  Many of the sanctions are based on United Nations and other international mandates, are multilateral in scope, and involve close cooperation 
with allied governments. 
9 Refer to Appendix R (“Enforcement Guidance”) for additional information.

Introduction  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  7 2/27/2015.V2  OFAC requirements are separate and distinct from the BSA, but both OFAC and the BSA 
share a common national security goal .  For this reason, many financial institutions view 
compliance with OFAC sanctions as related to BSA compliance obli gations; supervisory 
examination for BSA compliance is logically connected to the examination of a financial institution ’s compliance with OFAC sanctions.  Refer to  the core overview and examination 
procedures, “ Office of Foreign Assets Control ,” pages 142 and 152, respectively, for 
guidance.  
Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing  
The BSA is intended to safeguard the U.S. financial system and the financial institutions that make up that system from the abuses of financial crime, including money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financial transactions .  Money laundering and terrorist 
financing are financial crimes with potentially devastating social and financial effects .  From 
the profits of the narcotics trafficker to the assets  looted from government coffers by 
dishonest foreign officials, criminal proceeds have the power to corrupt and ultimately destabilize communities or entire economies .  Terrorist networks are able to facilitate their 
activities if they have financial means  and access to the financial system .  In both money 
laundering and terrorist financing, criminals can exploit loopholes and other weaknesses in the legitimate financial system to launder criminal proceeds,  finance terrorism,  or conduct 
other illegal activities , and, ultimately, hide the actual purpose of their activity. 
Banking organizations must develop, implement, and maintain effective AML programs that address the ever -changing strategies of money launderers and terrorists who attempt to gain 
access to the U.S. financial system .  A sound BSA/AML compliance program is critical in 
deterring and preventing these types of activities at, or through, banks and other financial institutions .  Refer to  Appendix F (“Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Red Fla gs”) 
for examples of suspicious activities that may indicate money laundering or terrorist 
financing.  
Money Laundering  
Money laundering is the criminal practice of processing ill-gotten gains, or “ dirty ” money, 
through a series of transactions; in this way the funds are “ cleaned ” so that they appear to be 
proceeds from legal activities .  Money laundering generally does not involve currency at 
every stage of the laundering process.  Although money launderi ng is a diverse and often 
complex process, it basically involves three independent steps that can occur simultaneously: 
Placement .  The first and most vulnerable stage of laundering money is placement.  The goal 
is to introduce the unlawful proceeds into t he financial system without attracting the attention 
of financial institutions or law enforcement.  Placement techniques include structuring 
currency deposits in amounts to evade reporting requirements or commingling currency deposits of legal and illegal enterprises .  An example may include: dividing large amounts of 
currency into less -conspicuous smaller sums that are deposited directly into a bank account, 
depositing a refund check from a canceled vacation package or insurance policy, or purchasing a series of monetary instruments (e.g., cashier ’s checks or money orders) that are 
then collected and deposited into accounts at another locat ion or financial institution .  Refer 
to Appendix G (“Structuring”) for additional guidance.

Introduction  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  8 2/27/2015.V2  Layering .  The second stage of the money laundering process is layering, which involves 
moving funds around the financial system, often in a complex series of transactions to create 
confusion and complicate the paper trail.  Examples of layering include exchanging monetary instrumen ts for larger or smaller amounts, or wiring or transferring funds to and through 
numerous accounts in one or more financial institutions. 
Integration.  The ultimate goal of the money laundering process is integration .  Once the 
funds are in the financial s ystem and insulated through the layering stage, the integration 
stage is used to create the appearance of legality through additional transactions.  These 
transactions further shield the criminal from a recorded connection to the funds by providing a plaus ible explanation for the source of the funds.  Examples include the purchase and resale 
of real estate, investment securities, foreign trusts, or other assets.  
Terrorist Financing  
The motivation behind terrorist financing is ideological as opposed to profit-seeking, which is generally the motivation for most crimes associated with money laundering .  Terrorism is 
intended to intimidate a population or to compel a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any specific act through the threat of violence.  An effective financial infrastructure is critical to terrorist operations .  Terrorist groups develop 
sources of funding that are relatively mobile to ensure that funds can be used to obtain material and other logistical items needed to commit terrorist acts .  Thus, money laundering 
is often a vital component of terrorist financing.  
Terrorists generally finance their activities through both unlawful and legitimate sources .  
Unlawful activities, such as extortion, kidnapping, and narcotics trafficking, have been found to be a major source of funding.  Other observed activities include smuggling, fraud, theft, robbery, identity theft, use of conflict diamonds,
10 and improper use of charitable or relief 
funds.  In the last case, donors may have no knowledge that their donations have been 
diverted to support terrorist causes. 
Other legitimate sources have also been found to provide terrorist organizations with 
funding; these legitimate funding sources are a key difference between terrorist financiers and traditional criminal organizations .  In addition to charitable donations, legitimate sources 
include foreign government sponsors, business ownership, and personal employment. 
Although the motivation differs between traditional money launde rers and terrorist 
financiers, the actual methods used to fund terrorist operations can be the same as or similar 
to those methods used by other criminals that launder funds.  For example, terrorist financiers 
use currency smuggling, structured deposits or withdrawals from bank accounts; purchases of 
various types of monetary instruments ; credit , debit , or prepaid  cards ; and funds transfers.  
There is also evidence that some forms of informal banking (e.g., “ hawala ”
11) have played a

internationally recognized governments and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, 
or in contravention of the decisions of the United Nations Security Council . 
11 “Hawala” refers to one specific type of informal value transfer system.  FinCEN describes hawala as “a 
method of monetary value transmission that is used in some parts of the world to conduct remittances, most 
often by persons who seek to legitimately sen d money to family members in their home country.  It has also

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  9 2/27/2015.V2  role in moving terrorist funds.  Transactions through hawalas are difficult to detect  given the 
lack of documentation, their size, and the nature of the transactions involved.  Funding for 
terrorist attacks does not always require large sums of money, and the associated transactio ns 
may not be complex. 
Criminal Penalties for Money Laundering, 
Terrorist Financing, and Violations of the BSA  
Penalties for money laundering and terrorist financing can be severe.  A person convicted of 
money laundering can face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000.12 Any 
property involved in a transaction or traceable to the proceeds of the criminal activity, including property such as loan collateral, personal property, and, under certain conditions, entire bank accounts (even if some of the money in the account is legitimate), may be subject to forfeiture .  Pursuant to various statutes, banks and individuals may incur criminal and civil 
liability for violating AML and terrorist financing laws .  For instance, pursuant to 18 USC 
1956 and 1957, the U.S. Department of Justice may bring criminal actions for money laundering that may include criminal fines, imprisonment, and forfeiture actions.
13 In 
addition, banks risk losing their charters, and bank employees risk being removed and barred 
from banking. 
Moreover, there are criminal penalties for willful violations of the BSA and its implementing 
regulations under 31 USC 5322 and for structuring transactions to evade BSA reporting requirements under 31 USC 5324(d).  For example, a person, including a bank employee, willfully violating the BSA or its implementing regulations is subject to a criminal fine of up to $250,000 or five years in prison, or both.
14 A person who commits such a violation while 
violating another U.S. law, or engaging in a pattern of criminal activity, is subject to a fine of up to $500,000 or ten years in prison, or both.
15 A bank that violates certain BSA provisions, 
including 31 USC 5318(i) or (j), or special measures imposed under 31 USC 5318A, faces criminal money penalties up to the greater of $1 million or twice the value of the 
transaction.
16 
Civil Penalties for Violations of the BSA  
Pursuant to 12 USC 1818(i) and 1786(k), and 31 USC 5321, the federal banking agencies and FinCEN, respectively, can bring civil money penalty actions for violations of the BSA.  Moreover, in addition to criminal and civil money penalty actions taken against them, individuals may be removed from banking pursuant to 12 USC 1818(e)(2) for a violation of

other illegal activity.” For additional information and guidance on hawalas and Fin CEN’s report to Congress in

Scoping and Planning — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  11 2/27/2015.V2  CORE EXAMINATION OVERVIEW AND 
PROCEDURES FOR ASSESSING THE BSA/AML 
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM  
Scoping and Planning — Overview 
Objective.  Identify the bank’s BSA/AML risks, develop the examination scope, and 
document the plan.  This process includes determining examination staffing needs and 
technical expertise, and selecting examination procedures to be completed.  
The BSA/AML examination is intended to assess the effectiveness of the bank ’s BSA/AML 
compliance program and the bank’s compliance with the regulatory requirements pertaining to the BSA, including a review of risk management practices.  
Whenever possible, the scoping and planning process should be completed before entering 
the bank.  During this process, it may be helpful to discuss BSA/AML matters with bank management, including the BSA compliance officer, either in person or by telephone.  T he 
scoping and planning process generally begins with an analysis of: 
•Off-site monitoring information.
•Prior examination reports and workpapers.
•Request letter items completed by bank managemen t.  Refer to Appendix H ( “Request
Letter Items  (Core and Expanded)”) for additional information.
•The bank’ s BSA/AML risk assessment.
•Information available from the BSA -reporting database, FinCEN Query.  FinCEN Query
replaced the former BSA -reporting database, the Web Currency Banking and Retrieval
System, as the system of records for all BSA reports  effective January 1, 2013.
•Independent reviews or audits.
Review of the Bank ’s BSA/AML Risk Assessment  
The scoping and planning process should be guided by the examiner ’s review of the bank ’s 
BSA/AML risk assessment .  Information gained from the examiner’s review of the risk 
assessment assist s the scoping and planning process as well as the evaluation of the adequacy 
of the BSA/AML compliance program.  If the bank has not developed a risk assessment, this 
fact should be discussed with management.  For the purposes of the examination, whenever 
the bank has not completed a risk assessment, or the risk assessment is inadequate, the examiner must complete a risk as sessment .  Refer to  the core overview section, “ BSA/AML 
Risk Assessment ,” page 24, for guidance on developing a BSA/AML risk assessment.  
Evaluating the BSA/AML risk assessment is part of scoping and planning the examination, and the inclusion of a section on risk assessment in the manual does not mean the two processes are separate.  Rather, risk assessment has been given its own section to emphasize its importance in the examination process and in the bank’s design of effective risk- based 
controls. 
--- Page 17 ---
Scoping and Planning — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  12 2/27/2015.V2  Independent Testing  
As part of the scoping and planning process, examiners should obtain and evaluate the 
supporting documents of the independent testing (audit) of the bank’ s BSA/AML compliance 
program.  The federal banking agencies’ reference to “audit” does not confer an expectation that the required independent testing must be performed by a specifically designated auditor, whether internal or external.  However, the person performing the independent testing must not be involved in any part of the bank’s BSA/ AML compliance program (for example, 
developing policies and procedures or conducting training).  Audit findings should be reported directly to the board of directors or a designated board committee composed 
primarily of or completely of outside directors. The scope and quality of the audit may 
provide examiners with a sense of particular risks in the bank, how these risks are being managed and controlled, and the status of compliance with the BSA.  The independent testing  scope and workpapers can assist examiners in understanding the audit coverage and 
the quality and quantity of transaction testing .  This knowledge assists the examiner in 
determining the examination scope, identifying areas requiring greater (or lesser) s crutiny, 
and identifying when expanded examination procedures may be necessary. 
Examination Plan  
At a minimum, examiners should conduct the examination procedures included in the 
following sections of this manual to ensure that the bank has an adequate BSA /AML 
compliance program commensurate with its risk profile: 
•Scoping and Planning ( refer to page 11).
•BSA/AML Risk Assessment ( refer to  page 18).
•BSA/AML Compliance Program ( refer to  page 28).
•Developing Conclusions and Finalizing the Examination ( refer to  page 40).
The “Core Examination Overview  and Procedures for Regulatory Requirements and Related 
Topics” section includes an overview and examination procedures for examining a bank’ s 
policies, procedures, and processes to ensure compliance with OFAC sanctions .  As part of 
the scoping and planning procedures, examiner s must  review the bank’ s OFAC risk 
assessment and independent testing to  determine the extent to which a review of the bank ’s 
OFAC  compliance program should be conduc ted during the examination.  Refer to core 
overview and examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets Control,” page 142 and 
152, respectively, for further guidance.  
The examiner should develop and document an initial examination plan commensurate with 
the overall BSA/AML risk profile of the bank.  This plan may change during the examination 
as a result of on -site findings, and any changes to the plan should likewise be documented.  
The examiner should prepare a request letter to the bank .  Suggested re quest letter items are 
detailed in Appendix H (“ Request Letter Items  (Core and Expanded)”).  On the basis of the 
risk profile, quality of audit, previous examination findings, and initial examination work, examiners should complete additional core and expanded examination procedures, as appropriate.  The examiner must include an evaluation of the BSA/AML compliance 
program within the supervisory plan or cycle.  At larger, more complex banking 
--- Page 18 ---
Scoping and Planning — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  13 2/27/2015.V2  organizations, examiners may complete various types of examinations throughout the 
supervisory plan or cycle to assess BSA/AML compliance.  These reviews may focus on one or more business lines (e.g., private banking, trade financing, or foreign correspondent banking relationships), based upon the banking organization’s risk assessment and recent 
audit and examination findings. 
Transaction Testing 
Examiners perform transaction testing to evaluate the adequacy of the bank ’s compliance 
with regulatory requirements, determine the effectiveness of its policies, procedure s, and 
processes, and evaluate suspicious activity monitoring systems.  Transaction testing is an 
important factor in forming conclusions about the integrity of the bank’s overall controls and risk management processes .  Transaction testing must be  perform ed at each examination  and 
should be risk- based .  Transaction testing can be performed either through conducting the 
transaction testing procedures within the independent testing (audit) section ( refer to the core 
examination procedures, “ BSA/AML Complianc e Program ,” page 38, for further guidance ) 
or completing the transaction testing procedures contained elsewhere within the core or 
expanded sections. 
The extent of transaction testing and activities conducted is based on various factors 
including the examiner’s judgment of risks, controls, and the adequacy of the independent 
testing .  Once on site, the scope of the transaction testing can be expanded to address any 
issues or concerns identified during the exam ination .  Examiners should document their 
decision regarding the extent of transaction testing to conduct, the activities for which it is to 
be performed, and  the rationale for any changes to the scope of transaction testing that occur 
during the examination. 
Information Available From BSA -Reporting Database  
The FinCEN Query replaced the BSA -reporting database, Web  Currency Banking and 
Retrieval System, as the system of records for all BSA reports.  Examination planning should 
also include an analysis of the Suspicious Activity Reports (S ARs), Currency Transaction 
Reports (CTR), and CTR exemptions that the bank has filed.  SARs, CTRs, and CTR exemptions may be exported or downloaded from or obtained directly online from the BSA -
reporting database ( FinCEN Query ).  Each federal banking agency has staff authorized to 
obtain this data from the BSA reporting database.  When requesting searches from the BSA  
reporting database, the examiner should contact the appropriate person (or persons), within his or her agency, sufficiently in advance of the examination start date in order to obtain the requested information.  When a bank has recently purchased or merged with another bank, the examiner should obtain SARs, CTRs, and CTR exemptions data on the acquired bank, a s 
well.  
Downloaded information can be displayed on an electronic spreadsheet, which contains all of the data included on the original document filed by the bank as well as the  BSA Identification Number (BSA -ID), and the date the document was entered into the BSA -
reporting database.  Downloaded information may be important to the examination, as it 
helps examiners:  
•Identify high -volume currency customers.

Scoping and P lanning — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  15 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Scoping and Planning  
Objective.  Identify the bank’s BSA/AML risks, develop the examination scope, and 
document the plan.  This process i ncludes determining examination staffing needs and 
technical expertise, and selecting examination procedures to be completed.  
To facilitate the examiner ’s understanding of the bank’s risk profile and to adequately 
establish the scope of the BSA/AML examination, the examiner should complete the 
following steps, in conjunction with the review of the bank’s BSA/AML risk assessment: 
1. Review prior examination or inspection reports, related workpapers, and management’ s
responses to any previously identified BSA issues; identify  completed  examination
procedures; obtain BSA contact information; identify reports  and processes the bank uses
to detect unusual activity; identify previously noted higher-risk banking operations;
review recommendations for the next examination .  In addition, contact  bank
management  as appropriate to discuss the following:
•BSA/AML compliance program.
•BSA/AML risk assessment.
•Suspicious activity monitoring and reporting systems.
•Level and extent of automated BSA/AML systems.
For the above topics, refer to the appropriate overview and examination procedures 
sections in the manual for guidance.  
2. Develop list of BSA items to be incorporated into the integrated examination request
letter .  If the BSA portion of the examination is a stand -alone examination, send the
request letter to the bank .  Review the request letter documents provided by the bank.
Refer to Appendix H (“ Request Letter Items  (Core and Expanded)” ).
3.Review  correspondence between the bank and its primary regulator , if not already
completed by the examiner in charge or other dedicated examination personnel.  In
addition, review  correspondence that the bank or the primary regulators have received
from, or sent to, outside regulatory and law enforcement agencies relat ing to BSA/AML
compliance.  Communications, particularly those received from FinCEN may document
matters relevant to the examination, such as the following:
•Filing errors for SARs , CTRs , and CTR exemptions received electronically from
FinCEN BSA E -Filing S ystem .  Refer to Appendix T for additional information on
filing through the BSA E- Filing System.
•Civil money penalties issued by or in process from FinCEN.
•Law enforcement subpoenas or seizures.
--- Page 21 ---
Scoping and P lanning — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  16 2/27/2015.V2  •Notification of ma ndatory account closures of non cooperati ve foreign customers
holding correspondent accounts as directed by the Secretary of the Treasury or the
U.S. Attorney General.
4. Review SARs, CTRs, and CTR exemption information obtained from the BSA-reporting
database.  The number of SARs, CTRs, and CTR exemptions filed should be obtained for
a defined time period, as determined by the examiner .  Consider the following
information, and analyze the data for unusual patterns, such as:
•Volume of activity, and whether it is commensurate with the customer ’s occup ation
or type of business.
•Number and dollar volume of transactions involving higher-risk customers.
•Volume of CTRs in relation to the volume of exemptions (i.e., whether additional
exemptions resulted in significant decreases in CTR filings).
•Volume of SARs and CTRs in relation to the bank’s size, asset or deposit growth, andgeographic location.
The federal banking agencies do not have targeted volumes or “quotas” for SAR and CTR filings for a given bank size or geographic location.  Examiners should not criticize a bank solely because the number of SARs or CTRs filed is lower than SARs or CTRs filed by “peer” banks.  However, as part of the examination, examiners must review 
significant changes in the volume or nature of SARs and CTRs filed and assess potential 
reasons for these changes.  
5.Review internal and  external audit reports and workpapers for BSA/AML compliance, as
necessary, to determine the comprehensiveness and quality of audits, findings, and
management responses and corrective action.  A revi ew of the independent audit’s scope,
procedures, and qualifications provides valuable information on the adequacy of the
BSA/AML compliance program.
6. While OFAC regulations are not part of the BSA, evaluation of OFAC compliance is
frequently included in BSA /AML examinations .  It is not the federal banking agencies’
primary role to identify OFAC violations, but rather to evaluate the sufficiency of a
bank’s implementation of policies, procedures, and processes to ensure compliance withOFAC laws and regulatio ns.  To facilitate the examiner’s understanding of the bank’s
risk profile and to adequately establish the scope of the OFAC examination, the examiner
should complete the following steps:
•Review the bank ’s OFAC risk assessment .  The risk assessment , which may be
incorporated into the bank’s overall BSA/AML risk assessment, should consider the
various types of products, services, customers, entities, transactions , and geographic
locations in which the bank is engaged, including those that are processed by,
through, or to the bank to identify potential OFAC exposure.
•Review the bank ’s independent testing of its OFAC compliance program.
--- Page 22 ---
Scoping and P lanning — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  17 2/27/2015.V2  •Review correspondence received from OFAC and , as needed, the civil penalties area
on the OFAC Web site to determine whether the bank had any warning letters, fines ,
or penalties imposed by OFAC since the most recent examination .
•Review correspondence between the bank and OFAC (e.g., periodic reporting of
prohibited transactions and, if applicable, annual OFAC reports on blocked property).
In addition to the above, at larger, more complex banking organizations, examiners may 
complete various types of examinations throughout the supervisory plan or cycle to 
assess OFAC compliance .  These reviews may focus on one or more business lines.  
7. On the basis of the above examination procedures, in conjunction with the review of the
bank’s BSA/AML risk assessment, develop an initial examination plan .  The examiner
should adequately document the plan, as well as any changes to the plan that occur during
the examination .  The scoping and planning process should ensure that the examiner is
aware of the bank ’s BSA/AML compliance program, OFAC compliance program,
compliance history, and risk profile (i.e., products, services, customers, entities,
transactions, and geographic locations).
As necessary, additional core and expanded examination procedures may be completed .  
While the examination plan may change at any time as a result of on -site findings, the initial 
risk assessment enables the examiner to establish a reasonable scope for the BSA/AML 
review .  In order for the examination process to be successful, examiners must maintain open 
communication with the bank’ s management and discuss relevant concerns as they arise.  
--- Page 23 ---
BSA/AML Risk Assessment — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  18 2/27/2015.V2  BSA/AML Risk Assessment — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the BSA/AML risk profile of the bank and evaluate the adequacy of the 
bank’ s BSA/AML risk assessment process.  
Evaluating the BSA/AML risk assessment should be part of scoping and planning the 
examination , and the inclusion of a section on risk assessment in the manual does not mean 
the two processes are separate.  Rather, risk assessment has been given its own section to 
emphasize its importance in the examination process and in the bank’s design of effective 
risk-based controls. 
The same risk management principles that the bank uses in traditional operational areas 
should be applied to assessing and managing BSA/AML risk.  A well -developed risk 
assessment assist s in identifying the bank’s BSA/AML risk profile.  Understanding the risk 
profile enables the bank to apply appropriate risk management processes to the BSA/AML compliance program to mitigate risk .  This risk assessment process enables management to 
better  identify and mitigate gaps in the bank’s controls.  The risk assessment should provide a 
comprehensive analysis of the BSA/AML risks in a concise and organized presentation, and should be shared and communicated with all business lines across the bank, board of directors, management, and appropriate staff; as such, it is a sound practice that the risk 
assessment be reduced to writing.   
There are many effective methods and formats used in completing a BSA/AML risk 
assessment; therefore, examiners should not advocate a particular method or format .  Bank 
management should decide the appropriate method or format, based on the bank’s particular 
risk profile .  Whatever format management  chooses to use for its risk assessment, it should 
be easily understood by all appropriate parties. 
The development of the BSA/AML risk assessment generally involves two steps: first, 
identify the specific risk categories (i.e., products, services, customers, entities, transactions, and geographic locations) unique to the bank; and second, conduct a more detailed analysis 
of the data identified to better assess the risk within these categories .  In reviewing the risk 
assessment  during the scoping and planning process, the examiner should determine whether 
management has considered al l products, services, customers, entities , transactions, and 
geographic locations, and whether management’s detailed analysis within these specific risk categories was adequate.  If the bank has not developed a risk assessment, this fact should be 
discusse d with management.  For the purposes of the examination, whenever the bank has 
not completed a risk assessment, or the risk assessment is inadequate, the examiner must 
complete a risk assessment  based on available information.
17 
Evaluating the Bank’s BSA/AML Risk Assessment  
An examiner must review the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program with sufficient 
knowledge of the bank’s BSA/AML risks in order to determine whether the BSA/AML 
compliance program is adequate and provides the controls necessary to mitigate risks.  For 
example, during the examination scoping and planning process, the examiner may initially 
17 Refer to  “Examiner Development of a BSA/AML Risk Assessment ,” page 24, for guidance.  
--- Page 24 ---
BSA/AML Risk Assessment — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  19 2/27/2015.V2  determine that the bank has a high -risk profile, but during the examination, the examiner may 
determine th at the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program adequately mitigates these  risks .  
Alternatively, the examiner may initially determine that the bank has a low - or moderate- risk 
profile; however, during the examination, the examiner may determine that the bank’s 
BSA/AML compliance program does not adequately mitigate the se risks.  
In evaluating the risk assessment, an examiner should not necessarily take any single 
indicator as determinative of the existence of a lower or higher BSA/AML risk.  The assessment of risk  factors is bank-specific, and a conclusion regarding the risk profile should 
be based on a consideration of all pertinent information.  Banks may determine that some factors should be weighed more heavily than others.  For example, the number of funds transfers is certainly one factor to be considered in assessing risk; however, in order to 
effectively identify and weigh the risks, the examiner should look at other factors associated with those funds transfers, such as whether they are international or dom estic, the dollar 
amounts involved, and the nature of the customer relationships. 
Identification of Specific Risk Categories  
The first step of the risk assessment process is to identify the specific products, services, 
customers, entities, and geographic locations unique to the bank.  Although attempts to launder money, finance terrorism, or conduct other illegal activities through a bank can emanate from many different sources, certain products, services, customers, entities, and 
geographic locations may be more vulnerable or have been historically abused by money 
launderers and criminals.  Depending on the specific characteristics of the particular product, service, or customer, the risks are not always the same.  Various factors, such as the number and volume of transactions, geographic locations, and nature of the customer relationships, should be considered when the bank prepares its risk assessment.  The differences in the way a bank interacts with the customer (face -to-face contact versus electronic ba nking) also 
should be considered.  Because of these factors , risks vary from one bank to another.  In 
reviewing the bank’s risk assessment, examiners should determine whether management has 
developed an accurate risk assessment that identifies the signific ant risks to the bank. 
The expanded sections in this manual provide guidance and discussions on specific lines of 
business, products, and customers that may present unique challenges and exposures for which banks may need to institute appropriate policies, procedures, and processes.  Absent appropriate controls, these lines of business, products, or customers could elevate aggregate BSA/AML risks .  The examiner should expect the bank’s ongoing risk assessment process to 
address the varying degrees of risk a ssociated with its products, services, customers , entities, 
and geographic locations, as applicable. 
Products and Services  
Certain products and services offered by banks may pose a higher risk of money laundering 
or terrorist financing depending on the nat ure of the specific product or service offered .  Such 
products and services may facilitate a higher degree of anonymity, or involve the handling of high volumes of currency or currency equivalents.  Some of these products and services are 
listed below, but the list is not all inclusive:

funds transfers (domestic and international), payable upon proper identification (PUPID)
transactions, third-party payment processors, remittance activity, automated
clearinghouse (ACH)  transactions , and automated teller machines (ATM) .
•Electronic banking.
•Private banking (domestic and international).
•Trust and asset management services.
•Monetary instruments.18
•F
oreign correspondent accounts (e.g., bulk shipments of currency, pouch activity,

•Trade finance.
•Services provided to third-party payment processors or senders.
•Foreign exchange.
•Special use or concentration accounts.
•Lending activities, particularly loans secured by cash collateral  and marketable securities.
•Nondeposit account services (e.g., nondeposit investment products and  insurance).
The expanded sections of the manual provide guidance and discussion on specific products and services detailed above.  
Customers and Entities  
Although any type of account is potentially vulnerable to money laundering or terrorist 
financing, by the nature of their business, occupation, or anticipated transaction activity, certain customers and entities may pose specific risks .  At this stage of the risk assessment 
process, it is essential that banks exercise judgment and neither define nor treat all members 
of a specific category of customer as posing the same level of risk .  In assessing customer 
risk, banks should consider other variables, such as services sought and geographic locations.  The expanded sections of the manual provide guidance and discussion on specific customers 
and entities that are detailed below:  
•Foreign financial institutions, including banks and foreign money services providers (e.g.,
casas de cambio , currency exchanges, and  money transmitters ).
•Nonbank financial institutions (e.g., money services businesses; casinos and card clubs;brokers/dealers in securities; and dealers in precious metals, stones, or jewels).
•Senior foreign political figures and their immediate family members and close associates(collectively known as politically exposed persons (PEP )).

18 Monetary instruments in this context include official bank checks, cashier’s checks, money orders, and 
traveler’s checks.  Refer to  the expanded overview section, “Purchase and Sale of Monetary Instruments,” page 
240, for further discussion on risk factors and risk mitigation regarding monetary instruments.

BSA/AML Risk Assessment — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  21 2/27/2015.V2  •Nonresident alien (NRA)20 and accounts of foreign individuals.
•Foreign corporations and domestic business entities, particularly offshore corporations
(such as domestic shell companies and Pr ivate Investment Companies (PIC ) and
international business corporations (IBC ))21 located in higher-risk geographic locations.
•Deposit brokers, particularly foreign deposit brokers.
•Cash -intensive businesses (e.g., convenience stores, restaurants, retail stores, liquor
stores, cigarette distributors, privately owned ATMs, vending machine operators, and
parking garages).
•Nongovernmental organizations and charities (foreign and domestic).
•Professional service providers (e.g., attorneys, accountants, doctors, or real estatebrokers).
Geographic Locations 
Identifying geographic locations that may pose a higher risk is essential to a bank’s 
BSA/AML compliance program .  U.S. banks should understand and evaluate the specific 
risks asso ciated with doing business in, opening accounts for customers from, or facilitating 
transactions involving certain geographic locations.  However, geographic risk alone does not necessarily determine a customer’s or transaction’s risk level, either positiv ely or 
negatively.  
Higher -risk geographic locations can be either international or domestic.  International 
higher-risk geographic locations generally include: 
•Countries subject to OFAC sanctions, including state sponsors of terrorism.

Analysis of Specific Risk Categories  
The second step of the risk assessment process entails a more detailed analysis of the data 
obtained during the identification stage in order to more accurately assess BSA/AML risk.  This step involves evaluating data pertaining to the bank’s activities (e.g., number of: domestic and international funds transfers; private banking customers; foreign correspondent accounts; PTA s; and domestic and international geographic locations of the bank’s business 
area and customer transactions) in relation to Customer Identification Program (CIP) and customer due diligence (CDD) information.  The level and sophistication of analysis may

the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Web site.  
26 OFCs offer a variety of financial products and services.  For additional information, including assessments of 
OFCs, refer to  the International Monetary Fund’s OFC page .  
27 The Basel Anti -Money Laundering (AML) Index  is an additional resource that may be useful in assisting 
banks to evaluate geographic locations.  The Basel AML Index is a composite index that evaluates indicators 
from various publicly available sources such as the FATF, World Bank, Transparency International and World 
Economic Forum.  
28 The Anti -Drug Abuse Act of 1988 and The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) 
Reauthorization Act of 1998 authorized the Director of ONDCP to designate areas within the United States that 
exhibit serious drug trafficking problems and harmfully impact other areas of the country as HIDTAs.  The 
HIDTA Program provides ad ditional federal resources to those areas to help eliminate or reduce drug 
trafficking and its harmful consequences.  A listing of these areas can be found at the White House’s Office of 
National Drug Control Policy Web site .  
29 HIFCAs were first announced in the 1999 National Money Laundering Strategy and were conceived in the 
Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998 as a means of concentratin g law enforcement 
efforts at the federal, state, and local levels in high intensity money laundering zones.  A listing of these areas can be found at  the FinCEN Web site
.

BSA/AML Risk Assessment — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  23 2/27/2015.V2  vary by bank.  The detailed analysis is important because within any type of product or 
category of customer there are accountholders that pose varying levels of risk. 
This step in the risk assessment process gives management a better understanding of the 
bank’s risk profile in order to develop the appropriate policies, procedures, and processes to 
mitigate the overall risk .  Specifically, the analysis of the data pertaining to the bank’s 
activities should consider, as appropriate, the following factors: 
•Purpose of the account.
•Actual or anticipated activity in the account.
•Nature of the customer’s business/occupation.
•Customer’s location.
•Types of products and services used by the customer.
The value of a two-step risk assessment process is illustrated in the following example .  The 
data collected in the first step of the risk assessment process reflects that a bank sends out 
100 international funds transfers per day.  Further analysis may show that approximately 90 percent of the funds transfers are recurring well -documented transactions for  long- term 
customers .  On the other hand, the analysis may show that 90 per cent of these transfers are 
nonrecurring or are for noncustomers.  While the numbers are the same for these two 
examples, the overall risks are different.  
As illustrated above, the bank’s CIP and CDD information take on important roles in this 
process .  Refer to  the core overview sections, “Customer Identification Program” and 
“Customer Due Diligence,” found on pages 47 and 56, respectively, for additional guidance. 
Developing the Bank’s BSA/AML Compliance Program Based Upon Its 
Risk Assessment  
Management should structure the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program to adequately address its risk profile, as identified by the risk assessment.  Management should understand the bank’s BSA/AML risk exposure and develop the appropriate policies, procedures, and processes to monitor and control BSA/AML risks .  For example, the bank’s monitoring 
systems to identify,  research, and report suspicious activity should be risk-based, with 
particular emphasis on higher-risk products, services, customers, entities, and geographic 
locations as identified by the bank’s BSA/AML risk assessment. 
Independent testing (audit) should review the bank’s risk assessment for reasonableness.  
Additionally, management should consider the staffing resources and the level of training necessary to promote adherence with these policies, procedures, and processes.  For those banks that assume a higher -risk BSA/AML profile, management should provide a more 
robust BSA/AML compliance program that specifically monitors and controls the higher 
risks that management and the board have accepted .  Refer to Appendix I (“Risk Assessment 
Link to the BSA/AM L Compliance Program”) for a chart depicting the risk assessment’s link 
to the BSA/AML compliance program. 
--- Page 29 ---
BSA/AML Risk Assessment — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  24 2/27/2015.V2  Consolidated  BSA/AML Compliance Risk Assessment  
Bank s that implement a consolidated or partially consolidated BSA/AML compliance 
program should assess risk both individually within business lines and across all activities 
and legal entities .  Aggregating BSA/AML risks on a consolidated  basis for larger or more 
complex organizations may enable an  organization to better identify risk s and risk exposures 
within and across specific lines of business or product categories.  Consolidated information 
also assists senior management and the board of directors in understanding and appropriately mitigating risks across the organization.  To avoid having an outdated understanding of the 
BSA/AML risk exposures, the banking organization should continually reassess its  
BSA/AML risks and communicate with business units, functions, and legal entities.  The 
identification of a BSA/AML risk or deficiency in one area of business may indicate concerns elsewhere in the organization, which management should identify and control.  Refer to the expanded overview section, “BSA/AML Compliance Program Structure s,” page 
155, for additional gui dance.  
Bank’s Updating of the Risk Assessment  
An effective BSA/AML compliance program controls risks associated with the bank’s products, services, customers, entities, and geographic locations; therefore, an effective risk 
assessment should be an ongoing process, not a one- time exercise.  Management should 
update its risk assessment to identify changes in the bank’s risk profile, as necessary (e.g., when new products and services are introduced, existing products and services change, higher-risk customers’ open and close accounts, or the bank expands through mergers and acquisitions).  Even in the absence of such changes, it is a sound practice for banks to 
periodically reassess their BSA/AML risks at least every 12 to 18 months. 
Examiner Development of a BSA/AML Risk Assessment 
In some situations, banks may not have performed or completed an adequate BSA/AML risk 
assessment and examiners must complete one based on available information.  When doing so, examiners do not have to use any particular format.  In such instances, documented 
workpapers should include the bank’s risk assessment, the deficiencies noted in the bank’s 
risk assessment, and the examiner -prepared risk assessment.  
Examiners should ensure that they have a general understanding of the bank’s BSA/AML 
risks and, at a minimum, document these risks within the examination scoping process.  This section provides some general guidance that examiners can use when they are required to complete a BSA/AML risk assessment .  In addition, examiners may share this information 
with bankers to develop or improve their own BSA/AML risk assessment. 
The risk assessment developed by examiners generally are not as comprehensive as one 
developed by a bank.  However, similar to what is expected in a bank’s risk asses sment, 
examiners should obtain information on the bank’s products, services, customers, entities, 
and geographic locations to determine the volume and trend for potentially higher- risk areas .  
This process can begin with an analysis of: 
•Information retrieved from FinCEN Query, the BSA -reporting database.
--- Page 30 ---
BSA/AML Risk Assessment — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  25 2/27/2015.V2  •Prior examination or inspection reports and workpapers.
•Response to request letter items.
•Discussions with bank management and appropriate regulatory agency personnel.
•Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) and Uniform Bank Performance Report
(UBPR).
Examiners should complete this analysis by reviewing the level and trend of information 
pertaining to banking activities identified, for example: 
•Funds transfers.
•Private banking.
•Mone tary instrument sales.
•Foreign correspondent accounts and PTA s.
•Branch locations.
•Domestic and international geographic locations of the bank’s business area.
This information should be evaluated relative to such factors as the bank’s total asset size, 
customer base, entities, products, services, and geographic locations.  Examiners should 
exercise caution if comparing information between banks and use their experience and insight when performing this analysis.  Specifically, examiners should avoid comparin g the 
number of SARs filed by a bank to those filed by another bank in the same geographic location .  Examiners can and should use their knowledge of the risks associated with 
products, services, customers, entities, and geographic locations to help them determine the 
bank’s BSA/AML risk profile.  Examiners may refer to Appendix J (“Quantity of Risk 
Matrix”) when completing this evaluation.  
After identifying potential higher-risk operations, examiners should form a preliminary 
BSA/AML risk profile of the bank.  The preliminary risk profile provides the examiner with 
the basis for the initial BSA/AML examination scope and the ability to determine the adequacy of the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program.  Banks may have an appetite for higher- risk activities, but these risks should be appropriately mitigated by an effective 
BSA/AML compliance program tailored to those specific risks.  
The examiner should develop an initial examination scoping and planning document commensurate with the preliminary BSA/AML risk profile .  As necessary, the examiner 
should identify additional examination procedures beyond the minimum procedures that must be completed during the examination.  While the initial scope may change during the examination, the preliminary risk profile enables the examiner to establish a reasonable scope 
for the BSA/AML review.  
Examiner Dete rmination of the Bank’s BSA/AML Aggregate Risk Profile  
During the “Developing Conclusions and Finalizing the Examination” phase of the 
BSA/AML examination, the examiner should assess whether the controls of the bank’s 
--- Page 31 ---
BSA/AML Risk Assessment — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  26 2/27/2015.V2  BSA/AML compliance program are appropriate to manage and mitigate its BSA/AML risks .  
Through this process the examiner should determine an aggregate risk profile for the bank.  
This aggregate risk profile should take into consideration the risk assessment developed either by the bank or by the examiner and should factor in the adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program .  Examiners should determine whether the bank’s BSA/AML 
compliance program is adequate to appr opriately mitigate the BSA/AML risks, based on the 
risk assessment .  The existence of BSA/AML risk within the aggregate risk profile should 
not be criticized as long as the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program adequately identifies, 
measures, monitors, and controls this risk as part of a deliberate risk strategy .  When the risks 
are not appropriately controlled, examiners must communicate to management and the board of directors the need to mitigate BSA/AML risk.  Examiners should document deficiencies as 
directed in the core examination procedures , “Developing Conclusions and Finalizing the 
Examination ,” page 43.

BSA/AML Risk Assessment  
Objective.  Assess the BSA/AML risk profile of the bank and evaluate the adequacy of the 
bank’s BSA/AML risk assessment process.  
1.Review the bank’s BSA/AML risk assessment .  Determine whether the bank has included
all risk areas, including any new products, services, or customers , entities,  and
geographic locations.  Determine whether the bank’s process for periodically reviewingand updating its BSA/AML risk assessment is adequate.
2. If the bank has not developed a risk assessment, or if the risk assessment is inadequate,
the examiner must complete a risk assessment.
3. Examiners should document and discuss the bank’s BSA/AML risk profile and any
identified deficiencies in the bank’s BSA/AML risk assessment process with bankmanagement.

BSA/AML Compliance Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  28 2/27/2015.V2  BSA/AML Compliance Program — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program.  Determine 
whether the bank has developed, administered, and maintained an effective program for 
compliance with the BSA and all of its implementing regulations. 
Review of the bank’s written policies, procedures, and processes is a first step in determining 
the overall adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program .  The completion of applicable 
core and, if warranted, expan ded examination procedures is necessary to support the overall 
conclusions regarding the adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program.  Examination findings should be discussed with the bank’s management, and significant findings must be 
included in the report of examination  or supervisory correspondence. 
The BSA/AML compliance program
30 must be written, approved by the board of directors,31 
and noted in the board minutes.  A bank must have a BSA/AML compliance program 
commensurate with its respective BSA/AML r isk profile.  Refer to the core overview section, 
“BSA/AML Risk Assessment ,” page  18, for additional guidance on developing a BSA/AML 
risk assessment .  Refer to Appendix I (“ Risk Assessment Link to the BSA/AML Compliance 
Program ”) for a chart depicting the risk assessment’s link to the BSA/AML compliance 
program .  Furthermore, the BSA/AML compliance  program must be fully implemented and 
reasonably designed to meet the BSA requirements .32 Policy statements alone are not 
sufficient; practices must coincide with the bank ’s written policies, procedures, and 
processes .  The BSA/AML compliance program must provide for the following minimum 
requirements:  
•A system of internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance.
•Independent testing of BSA/ AML compliance.
30 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (Federal Reserve)  requires Edge and agreement 
corporations and U.S. branches, agencies, and other offices of foreign banks supervised by the Federal Reserve 
to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to ensure and m onitor compliance with the BSA and 
related regulations (refer to Regulation K, 12 CFR 211.5(m)(1) and 12 CFR 211.24(j)(1)).  In addition, because the BSA does not apply extraterritorially, foreign offices of domestic banks are expected to have policies, 
procedures, and processes in place to protect against risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (12 CFR 
208.63 and 12 CFR 326.8).  
31 The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency  (OCC) , each require the U.S. branches, agencies, and representative offices of the foreign banks 
they supervise operating in the United States to develop written BSA compliance programs that are approved by 
their respective bank’s board of directors and  noted in the minutes, or that are approved by delegatees acting 
under the express authority of their respective bank’s board of directors to approve the BSA compliance programs.  “Express authority” means the head office must be aware of its U.S. AML prog ram requirements 
and there must be some indication of purposeful delegation.  For those U.S. branches, agencies, and representative office of foreign banks that were already in compliance with existing obligations under the BSA (and usual and customary business practices), the BSA compliance program requirement should not impose additional burden.  Refer to 71 Fed. Reg.  13936 (March 20, 2006).  Refer to expanded overview section, 
“Foreign Branches and Offices of U.S. Banks,” page  164, for further guidance.  
32 Refer to Appendix R  (“Enforcement Guidance”) , for additional information.

BSA/AML Compliance Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  29 2/27/2015.V2  •Designate an individual or individuals responsible for managing BSA compliance (BSA
compliance officer).
•Training for appropriate personnel.
In addition, a CIP must be included as part of the BSA/AML compliance program.  Refer to the core overview section , “Customer Identification Program,” page 47, for additional 
guidance.  
Internal Controls  
The board of directors, acting through senior management, is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the bank maintains an effective BSA/AML internal control structure, including suspicious activity monitoring and reporting.  The board of directors and management should create a culture of compliance to ensure staff adherence to the bank ’s BSA/AML policies, 
procedures, and processes.  Internal controls are the bank ’s policies, procedures, and 
processes designed to limit and control risks and to achieve compliance with the BSA.  The level of sophistication of the internal controls should be commensurate with the size, structure, risks, and complexity of t he bank .  Large complex banks are more likely to 
implement departmental internal controls for BSA/AML compliance .  Departmental internal 
controls typically address risks and compliance requirements unique to a particular line of 
business or department and are part of a comprehensive BSA/AML compliance program.  
Internal controls should: 
•Identify banking operations ( i.e., products, services, customers, entities, and geographic
locations) more vulnerable to abuse by money launderers and criminals; provide for
periodic updates to the bank’s risk profile; and provide for a BSA/AML compliance
program tailored to manage risks.
•Inform the board of directors, or a committee thereof, and senior management, of
compliance initiatives, identified compliance deficiencies,  and corrective action taken,
and notify directors and senior management of SARs  filed.
•Identify a person or persons responsible for BSA/AML compliance.
•Provide for program continuity despite changes in management or employee composition
or structure.
•Meet  all regulatory recordkeeping and reporting requirements, meet recommendations for
BSA/AML compliance , and provide for timely updates in response to changes in
regulations.
33
•I
mplement risk -based CDD policies, procedures, and processes.
•Identify reportable transactions and accurately file all required reports including SARs,
CTRs,  and CTR exemptions.  (Banks should consider centralizing the review and report-
filing functions within the banking organization.)
33 Refer to Appendix P (“BSA Record Retention Requirements”) for guidance.  
--- Page 35 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  30 2/27/2015.V2  •Provide for dual controls and the segregation of duties  to the extent possible.  For
example, employees that complete the reporting forms (such as SARs, CTRs, and CTR
exemptions) generally should not also be responsible for the decision to file  the reports or
grant the exemptions.
•Provide sufficient controls and systems for filing CTRs and CTR exemptions.
•Provide sufficient controls and monitoring systems for timely detection and reporting ofsuspicious activity.
•Provide for adequate supervision of employees that handle currency transactions,complete  reports, grant exemptions, monitor for suspicious activity, or engage in any
other activity covered by the BSA and its implementing regulations.
•Incorporate BSA compliance into the job descriptions and performance evaluations ofbank personnel, as appropr iate.
•Train employees to be aware of their responsibilities under the BSA regulations and
internal policy guidelines.
The above list is not designed to be all- inclusive and should be tailored to reflect the 
bank’s BSA/AML risk profile .  Additional policy g uidance for specific risk areas is 
provided in the expanded sections of this manual.  
Independent Testing  
Independent testing (audit) should be conducted by the internal audit department, outside 
auditors, consultants, or other qualified independent parties.  While the frequency of audit is not specifically defined in any statute, a sound practice is for the bank to conduct independent testing generally every 12 to 18 months, commensurate with the BSA/AML risk 
profile of the bank.  Banks that do not employ outside auditors or consultants or have internal audit departments may comply with this requirement by using qualified persons who are not involved in the function being tested.  The persons conducting the BSA/AML testing should report directly to the board of directors or to a designated board committee comprised primarily or completely of outside directors. Banks that employ outside auditors or 
consultants should ensure that qualified persons doing the BSA/AML testing are not involved in other BSA functions such as training or developing policies and procedures that may 
present a conflict or lack of independence.  
Those persons responsible for conducting an objective independent evaluation of the written 
BSA/AML compliance program should perform testing for specific compliance with the BSA, and evaluate pertinent management information systems (MIS) .  The audit should be 
risk based and evaluate the quality of risk management for all banking operations, departments, and subsidiaries.  Risk -based audit programs vary depending on the bank’ s size, 
complexity, scope of activities, risk profile, quality of control functions, geographic diversity, and use of technology.  An effective risk -based auditing program covers all of the bank’ s 
activities .  The frequency and depth of each activity’s audit var ies according to the activity ’s 
risk assessment .  Risk -based auditing enables the board of directors and auditors to use the 
bank’ s risk assessment to focus the audit scope on the areas of greatest concern .  The testing 
--- Page 36 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  31 2/27/2015.V2  should assist the board of directors and management in identifying areas of weakness or areas 
where there is a need for enhancements or stronger controls. 
Independent testing should, at a minimum, include: 
•An evaluation of the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the BSA/AML compliance
program, including policies, procedures, and processes.  Typically, this evaluation
includes an explicit statement about the BSA/AML compliance program’s overall
adequacy and effectiveness and compliance with applicable regul atory requirements .  At
the very least, the audit should contain sufficient information for the reviewer (e.g., anexaminer, review auditor, or BSA officer) to reach a conclusion about the overall quality
of the BSA/AML compliance program.
•A review of the bank’ s risk assessment for reasonableness given the bank ’s risk profile
(products, services, customers, entities, and geographic locations).
•Appropriate risk- based transaction testing to verify the bank ’s adherence to the BSA
recordkeeping and reporting requirements (e.g., CIP, SARs, CTRs and CTR exemptions,and information sharing requests).
•An evaluation of management’s efforts to resolve violations and deficiencies noted in
previous audits and regulatory examinations, including progress in addressing
outstanding supervisory actions, if applicable.
•A review of staff training for adequacy, accuracy, and completeness.
•A review of the effectiveness of the suspicious activity monitoring systems (manual,
automated, or a combination) used for BSA/AML compliance.  Related reports may
include, but are not limited to:
–Suspicious activity monitoring reports.
–Large currency aggregation reports.
–Monetary instrument records.
–Funds transfer records.
–Nonsufficient funds (NSF) reports.
–Large balance fluctuation reports.
–Account relationship reports.
•An assessment of the overall process for identifying and reporting suspicious activity,
including a review of filed or prepared SARs to determine their accuracy, timeliness,
completeness, and effectiveness of the bank ’s policy.
•An assessment of the integrity and accuracy of MIS used in the BSA/AML compliance
program.  MIS includes reports used to identify large currency transactions, aggregate
daily currency transactions, funds transfer transactions, monetary instrument sales
transactions , and analytical and trend reports.
--- Page 37 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  32 2/27/2015.V2  Auditors should document the audit scope, procedures performed, transaction testing 
completed, and findings of the review.  All audit documentation and workpapers should be available for examiner review .  Any violations, policy or procedures exceptions, or other 
deficiencies noted during the audit should be included in an audit report and reported to the board of directors or a designated committee in a timely manner.  The board or designated committee and the audit staff should track audit deficiencies and document corrective 
actions.  
BSA Compliance Officer  
The bank’s board of directors must designate a qualified individual to serve as the BSA compliance officer.
34 The BSA compliance officer is responsible for coordinating and 
monitoring day- to-day BSA/AML compliance .  The BSA compliance officer is also charged 
with managing all aspects of the BSA/AML compliance program and with managing the bank’s adherence to the BSA and its implementing regulations; however, the board of 
directors is ultimately responsible for the bank’ s BSA/AML compliance.  
While the title of the individual responsible for overall BSA/AML compliance is not 
important, his or her level of authority and responsibility within the bank is critical.  The BSA compliance officer may delegate BSA/AML duties to other employees, but the officer should be responsible for overall BSA/AML compliance.  The board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the BSA compliance officer has sufficient authority and resources (monetary, physical, and personnel) to administer an effective BSA/AML 
compliance program based on the bank’ s risk profile.  
The BSA compliance officer should be fully knowledgeable of the BSA and all related 
regulations.  The BSA compliance of ficer should also understand the bank’s products, 
services, customers, entities, and geographic locations, and the potential money laundering 
and terrorist financing risks associated with those activities .  The appointment of a BSA 
compliance officer is no t sufficient to meet the regulatory requirement if that person does not 
have the expertise, authority, or time to satisfactorily complete the job.  
The line of communication should allow the BSA compliance officer to regularly apprise the board of directors and senior management of ongoing compliance with the BSA.  Pertinent BSA -related information, including the reporting of SARs filed with FinCEN, should be 
reported to the board of directors or an appropriate board committee so that these individuals can m ake informed decisions about overall BSA/AML compliance.  The BSA compliance 
officer is responsible for carrying out the direction of the board and ensuring that employees 
adhere to the bank ’s BSA/AML policies, procedures, and processes.  
Training  
Banks must ensure that appropriate personnel are trained in applicable aspects of the BSA.  
Training should include regulatory requirements and the bank’ s internal BSA/AML policies, 
34 The bank must designate one or more persons to coordinate and monitor day -to-day compliance.  This 
requirement is detailed in the federal banking agencies’ BSA compliance program regulations: 12  CFR 208.63, 
12 CFR 211.5(m), and 12 CFR 211.24(j) (Federal Reserve); 12 CFR 326.8 (FDIC ); 12 CFR 748.2 ( NCUA ); 12 
CFR 21.21 ( OCC).  
--- Page 38 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  33 2/27/2015.V2  procedures, and processes.  At a minimum, the bank ’s training program must provide training 
for all personnel whose duties require knowledge of the BSA.  The training should be 
tailored to the person’ s specific responsibilities .  In addition, an overview of the BSA/AML 
requirements typically should be given to new staff during employee orientation .  Training 
should encompass information related to applicable business lines, such as trust services, international, and private banking.  The BSA compliance officer should receive periodic training that is relevant and appropriate given changes to regulatory requirements as well as 
the activities and overall BSA/AML risk profile of the bank. 
The board of directors and senior management should be informed of changes and new 
developments in the BSA, its implementing regulations and directives, and  the federal 
banking agencies ’ regulations.  While the board of directors may not require the same degree 
of training as banking operations personnel, they need to understand the importance of BSA/AML regulatory requirements, the ramifications of noncompliance, and the risks posed 
to the bank.  Without a general understanding of the BSA, the board of directors cannot adequately provide BSA/AML oversight; approve BSA/AML policies, procedures, and 
processes; or provide sufficient BSA/AML resources. 
Training should be ongoing and incorporate current developments and changes to the BSA 
and any related regulations .  Changes to internal policies, procedures, processes, and 
monitoring systems should also be covered during training.  The  training  program should 
reinforce the importance that the board and senior management place on the bank’ s 
compliance with the BSA and ensure that all employees understand their role in maintaining 
an effective BSA/AML compliance program.  
Examples of money laundering activity and suspicious activity monitoring and reporting can 
and should be tailored to each individual audience .  For example, training for tellers should 
focus on examples involving large currency transactions or other suspicious activities; training for the loa n department should provide examples involving money laundering 
through lending arrangements. 
Banks should document their training programs.  Training and testing materials, the dates of 
training sessions, and attendance records should be maintained by the bank and be available 
for examiner review.

it contains the following required elements:
•A system of internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance.
•Independent testing of BSA compliance.
•A specifically designated person or persons responsible for managing BSA
compliance (BSA compliance officer).
•Training for appropriate personnel.
A bank must have a BSA/AML compliance program commensurate with its respective 
BSA/AML risk profile .  In addition, a CIP must be included as part of the BSA/AML 
compliance program.  
2.Assess whether the board of directors and senior management receive adequate reports on
BSA/AML compliance.
Risk Assessment Link to the BSA/AML Compliance Program  
3. On the basis of examination procedures completed in the scoping and planning process,
including the review of the risk assessment, determine whether the bank has adequately
identif ied the risk within its banking operations (products, services, customers, entities,
and geographic locations) and incorporated the risk into the BSA/AML complianceprogram.  Refer to Appendix I (“ Risk Assessment Link to the BSA/AML Compliance
Program ”) when performing this analysis.
35 The Federal Reserve, the FDIC , and the OCC each require the U.S. branches, agencies, and representative 
offices of the foreign banks they supervise operating in the United States to develop written BSA compliance 
programs that are approved by their respective bank’s board of directors and noted in the minutes, or that are 
approved by delegates acting under the express authority of their respective bank’s board of directors to approve 
the BSA compliance programs.  “Express authority” means the head office must be aware of its U.S. AML program requirements and there must be some indication of purposeful delegation.  For those U.S. branches, 
agencies, and representative office of foreign banks that were already in compliance with existing obligations under the BSA (and usual and customary b usiness practices), the BSA compliance program requirement should 
not impose additional burden.  Refer to 71 Fed. Reg.  13936 (March 20, 2006).  Refer to expanded overview 
section, “Foreign Branches and Offices of U.S. Banks,” page 164, for further guidance .  
36 The Federal Reserve requires Edge and agreement corporations and U.S. branches, agencies, and other offices 
of foreign banks supervised by the Federal Reserve to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the BSA and related regulations (refer to Regulation K, 12 CFR 211.5(m)(1) and 12 CFR 211.24(j)(1)).  In addition, because the BSA does not apply extraterritorially, foreign 
offices of domestic banks are expected to have policies, procedures, and proces ses in place to protect against 
risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (12  CFR 211.24(j)(1) and 12 CFR 326.8).

BSA/AML Compliance Program — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  35 2/27/2015.V2  Internal Controls  
4.Determine whether the BSA/AML compliance program includes policies, procedures,
and processes that:
•Identify higher -risk banking operations (products, services, customers, entities, and
geographic locations); provide for periodic updates to the bank’s risk profile; and
provide for a BSA/AML compliance program tailored to manage risks.
•Inform the board of directors, or a committee thereof, and senior management, of
compliance initiatives, identified compliance d eficiencies, SARs  filed, and corrective
action taken.
•Identify a person or persons responsible for BSA/AML compliance.
•Provide for program continuity despite changes in management or employee
composition or structure.
•Meet all regulatory requirements, meet  recommendations for BSA/AML compliance,
and provide for timely updates to implement changes in regulations.
•Implement risk -based CDD policies, procedures, and processes.
•Identify reportable transactions and accurately file all required reports, includingSARs, CTRs,  and CTR exemptions.  (Banks should consider centralizing the review
and report-filing functions within the banking organization.)
•Provide for dual controls and the segregation of duties to the extent possible.  For
example, employees that complete the reporting forms (such as SARs, CTRs, and
CTR exemptions) generally should not also be responsible for the decision to file  the
reports or grant the exemptions.
•Provide sufficient controls and monitoring systems for the timely detection and
reporting of suspicious activity.
•Provide for adequate supervision of employees that handle currency transactions,
complete reports, grant exemptions, monitor for suspicious activity, or engage in any
other activity covered by the BSA and its implementing regulations.
•Train employees to be aware of their responsibilities under the BSA regulations andinternal policy guidelines.
•Incorporate BSA compliance into job descriptions and performance evaluations of
appropriate personnel.
Independent Testing 
5.Determine whether the BSA/AML testing (audit) is independent ( i.e., performed by a
person (or persons) not involved with the bank’ s BSA/AML compliance staff) and
whether persons conducting the testing report directly to the board of directors or to a
designated board committee comprised primarily or completely of outside directors.
--- Page 41 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  36 2/27/2015.V2  6. Evaluate the qualifications of the person (or persons) performing the independent testing
to assess whether the bank can rely upon the findings and conclusions.
7.Validate the auditor ’s reports and workpapers to determine whether the bank ’s
independent testing is comprehensive, accurate, adequate, and timely.  The independent
test should address the following:
•The overall adequacy and effectiveness of the BSA/AML compliance program,
including policies, procedures, and processes.  Typically, this evaluation includes an
explicit statement about the BSA/AML compliance program’s overall adequacy and
effectiveness and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  At the very
least, the audit should contain sufficient information for the reviewer (e.g., anexaminer, review auditor, or BSA officer) to reach a conclusion about the overall
quality of the BSA/AML compliance program.
•BSA/AML risk assessment.
•BSA reporti ng and recordkeeping requirements.
•CIP implementation.
•CDD policies, procedures, and processes and whether they comply with internal
requirements.
•Personnel adherence to the bank’s BSA/AML policies, procedures, and processes.
•Appropriate transaction testing, with particular emphasis on higher-risk operations(products, services , customers, and geographic locations).
•Training, including its comprehensiveness, accuracy of materials, the trainingschedule, and attendance tracking.
•The integrity and accuracy of MIS  used in the BSA/AML compliance program.  MIS
includes reports used to identify large currency transactions, aggregate daily currencytransactions, funds transfer transactions, monetary instrument sales transactions, and
analytical and trend reports .
•Tracking of previously identified issues and deficiencies and verification that they
have been corrected by management.
•If an automated system is not used to identify or aggregate large transactions,
determine whether the audit or independent review includes a sample test check of
tellers ’ cash proof sheets, tapes, or other documentation to determine whether large
currency transactions are accurately identified and reported.
8.Determine whether the audit ’s review of suspicious activity monitoring systems includes
an evaluation of the system’ s ability to identify unusual activity .  Ensure through a
validation of the auditor’s reports and workpapers that the bank’s independent testing:
•Reviews policies, procedures, and processes for suspicious activity monitoring.
•Evaluates the system ’s methodology for establishing and applying expected activity
or filtering criteria.
--- Page 42 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  37 2/27/2015.V2  •Evaluates the system ’s ability to generate monitoring reports.
•Determines whether the system filtering criteria are reasonable and include, at a
minimum, cash, monetary instruments, funds transfers, and other higher- risk
products, services, customers , or geographies, as appropriate .
9.Determine whether the audit ’s review of suspicious activity reporting systems includes an
evaluati on of the research and referral  of unusual activity.  Ensure through a validation of
the auditor’s reports and workpapers that the bank’s independent testing includes a
review of policies, procedures, and processes for referring unusual activity from allbusiness lines (e.g. , legal, private banking, foreign correspondent banking) to the
personnel or department responsible for evaluating unusual activity.
10. Review the audit scope, procedures, and workpapers to determine adequacy of the audit
based on the following:
•Overall audit coverage and frequency in relation to the risk profile of the bank.
•Board reporting and supervision of, and its responsiveness to, audit findings.
•Adequacy of transaction testing, particularly for higher-risk banking operations and
suspicious activity monitoring systems.
•Competency of the auditors or independent reviewers regarding BSA/AMLrequirements.
BSA Compliance Officer  
11. Determine whether the board of directors has designated a person or persons responsible
for the overall BSA/AML c ompliance program .  Determine whether the BSA compliance
officer has the necessary authority and resources to effectively execute all duties.
12.Assess the competency of the BSA compliance officer and his or her staff, as necessary .
Determine whether the BSA  compliance area is sufficiently staffed for the bank ’s overall
risk level (based on products, services, customers, entities, and geographic locations),
size, and BSA/AML compliance needs.  In addition, ensure that no conflict of interest
exists and that staff is given adequate time to execute all duties.
Training  
13.Determine whether the following elements are adequately addressed in the trainingprogram and materials:
•The importance the board of directors and senior management place on ongoing
education, training, and compliance.
•Employee accountability for ensuring BSA compliance.
•Comprehensiveness of training, considering specific risks of individual businesslines.
--- Page 43 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  38 2/27/2015.V2  •Training of personnel from all applicable areas of the bank.37
•F
requency of training.
•Docume ntation of attendance records and training materials.
•Coverage of bank policies, procedures, processes, and new rules and regulations.
•Coverage of different forms of money laundering and terrorist financing as it relates
to identification and examples of suspicious activity.
•Penalties for noncompliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements.
Transaction Testing  
Transaction testing must include, at a minimum, either examination procedures detailed 
below (independent testing) or transaction testing procedures selected from within the core or expanded sections.  While some transaction testing is required, examiners have the discretion to decide what testing to conduct.  Examiners should document their decision regarding the extent of transacti on testing to conduct and the activities where it is to be performed, as well 
as the rationale for any changes to the scope of transaction testing that occur during the examination .  Examiners should consider the following when determining how to proceed 
with transaction testing:  
•Accounts or customers identified in the review of information obtained from
downloads from the BSA- reporting database.
•Higher -risk products and services, customer and entities, and geographic locations for
which it appears from the scoping and planning process that the bank may not haveappropriate internal controls.
•New products and services, customers and entities, and geographi es introduced in to
the bank’s portfolio since the previous BSA/AML examination.
Independent Testing 
14.Select a judgmental sample that includes transactions other than those tested by theindependent auditor and determine whether independent testing:
•Is comprehensive, adequate, and timely.
•Has reviewed the accuracy of MIS used in the BSA/AML compliance program.
•Has reviewed suspicious activity monitoring systems to include the identification of
unusual activity.
•Has reviewed whether suspicious activity reporting systems include the research and
referral of unusual activity.
37 As part of this element, determine whether the bank conducts adequate training for any agents who are 
responsible for conducting CIP  or other BSA -related functions on behalf of the bank.

BSA/AML Compliance Program — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  39 2/27/2015.V2  Preliminary Evaluation  
After the exami ner has completed the review of all four required elements of the bank’ s 
BSA/AML compliance program, the examiner should document a preliminary evaluation of 
the bank’ s program .  At this point, the examiner should revisit the initial examination plan, in 
order to determine whether any strengths or weaknesses identified during the review of the institution ’s BSA/AML compliance program warrant adjustments to the initial planned 
scope.  The  examiner may complete the core examination procedures, “ Office of Fore ign 
Assets Control,” page  152.  The examiner should document and support any changes to the 
examination scope, then proceed to the applicable core and, if warranted, expanded examination procedures .  If there are no changes to the examination scope, the examiner 
should proceed to the core examination procedures, “Developing Conclusions and Finalizing 
the Examination ,” page  43. 
--- Page 45 ---
Developing Conclusions and Finalizing the Examination — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  40 2/27/2015.V2  Developing Conclusions and Finalizing the Examination — 
Overview 
Objective.  Formulate conclusions, communicate findings to management, prepare report 
comments, develop an appropriate supervisory response, and close the examination. 
In the final phase of the BSA/AML ex amination, the examiner should assemble all findings 
from the examination procedures completed .  From those findings, the examiner should 
develop and document conclusions about the BSA/AML compliance program’s adequacy, 
discuss preliminary conclusions with bank management, present these conclusions in a written format for inclusion in the report of examination  (ROE), and determine and document 
what regulatory response, if any, is appropriate. 
In some cases, the appropriate regulatory response includes the citation of a regulatory 
violation .  The citation of violations of law and regulation is typically done in the context of 
supervisory activities .  The extent t o which violations affect  the evaluation of a bank’s 
BSA/AML compliance program is based on the nature, duration, and severity of noncompliance.  In some cases, an agency may allow the bank to remedy the violation as part of the supervisory process.  In appropriate circumstances, however, an agency may take 
either  informal or formal enforcement a ctions to address violations of the BSA 
requirements.
38 
Systemic or Recurring Violations  
Systemic or recurring violations of the BSA and its implementing regulations involve either a substantial deficienc y or a repeated failure to effectively and accurately  record and report 
information required under the BSA, if the errors or incompleteness impair the integrity of the record or report, fail to adequately represent the transactions required to be reported, or impact the effectiveness of the bank’s suspicious activity monitoring and reporting processes.  Systemic violations are the result of ineffective systems or controls to obtain, analyze, and maintain required information, or to report customers, accounts, or transactions, as required under various provisions of the BSA.  Recurring violations are repetitive occurrences of the same or similar issues .  Unlike isolated or inadvertent issues, systemic or recurring issues 
demonstrate a pattern or practice of noncompliance with the BSA and its implementing 
regula tions. 
When evaluating whether violations represent a pattern or practice, examiners must analyze 
the pertinent facts and circumstances .  Repeated, regular, usual, or institutionalized practices 
typically constitute a pattern or practice.  The totality of the circumstances must be 
considered when assessing whether a pattern or practice exists.  
Considerations in determining whether a pattern or practice exists include, but are not limited to: 
38 The Interagency Enforcement Statement (refer to Appendix R) explains the basis for the federal banking 
agencies’ enforcement of specific AML requirements of the BSA.  
--- Page 46 ---
Developing Conclusions and Finalizing the Examination — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  41 2/27/2015.V2  •Whether  the number of violations is high when compared to the bank ’s total activity .
This evaluation usually is determined through a sampling of transactions or records.
Based on this process, determinations are made concerning the overall level ofnoncompliance.  However, even if the violations are few in number they could reflect
systemic noncompliance, depending on the severity (e.g., significant or egregious).
•Whether there is evidence of similar violations by the bank in a series of transactions or
in different divisions or departments.  This is not an exact calcul ation and examiners
should balance the number, significance, and frequency of violations identifiedthroughout the organization.  Violations identified within various divisions ordepartments may or may not indicate a systemic violation .  These violations should be
evaluated in a broader context to determine if training or other compliance system
weaknesses are also present.
•The relationship of the violations to one another ( e.g., whether they all occurred in the
same area of the bank, in the same product line, in the same branch or department, or
with one employee).
•The impact the violation  or violations have on the bank’s suspicious activity monitoring
and reporting capabilitie s.
•Whether the violations appear to be grounded in a written or unwritten policy or
established procedure, or result from  a lack of an established procedure.
•Whether there is a common source or cause of the violations.
•Whether the violations were the result of an isolated software problem in a BSA/AML
reporting software product and whether the bank has taken appropriate steps to address
the issue.
Systemic or recurring violations of the BSA could have a significant impact on the adequacy 
of the bank’ s BSA/A ML compliance program .  When systemic instances of noncompliance 
are identified, the examiner should consider the noncompliance in the context of the overall program (internal controls, training, independent testing, responsible person) and refer to the Interagency Enforcement Statement (Appendix R) to determine whether the bank’s 
BSA/AML compliance program is deficient as a result of the systemic noncompliance.  All systemic violations should be brought to the attention of the bank’s board of directors and 
management and documented in the report of e xamination  or supervisory correspondence. 
Types of systemic or recurring violations may include, but are not limited to: 
•Failure to establish a due diligence program that includes a risk -based approach, and
when necessary, enhanced policies, procedures, and controls concerning foreign
correspondent accounts.
•Failure to maintain a reasonably designed due diligence program for private banking
accounts for non-U.S. persons (as defined in 31 CFR 1010.620).
•Frequent,  consistent, or recurring late CTR or SAR filings.
•A significant number of CTRs or SARs with errors or omissions of data elements.
--- Page 47 ---
Developing Conclusions and Finalizing the Examination — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  42 2/27/2015.V2  •Consistently failing to obtain or verify required customer identification information at
account opening.
•Consistently failin g to complete searches on 314(a) information requests.
•Failure to consistently maintain or retain records required by the BSA.
Also, the Interagency Enforcement Statement provides that “[t]he Agencies will cite a violation of the SAR regulations, and will take appropriate supervisory actions, if the organization’s failure to file a SAR (or SARs) evidences a systemic breakdown in its policies, procedures, or processes to identify and research suspicious activity, involves a pattern or practice of noncomplian ce with the filing requirement, or represents a significant 
or egregious situation.”
39
Isolated or Technical Violations  
Isolated or technical violations are limited instances of noncompliance with the BSA that occur within an otherwise adequate system of policies, procedures, and processes.  These violations generally do not prompt serious regulatory concern or reflect negatively on management’s supervision or commitment to BSA compliance, unless the isolated violation represents a significant or egregious s ituation or is accompanied by evidence of bad faith.  
Multiple isolated violations throughout bank departments or divisions can be indicative of 
systemic or recurring system weaknesses or violations.  
Corrective action for isolated violations is usually undertaken by the bank’s management 
within the normal course of business.  All violations, regardless of type or significance , 
should be brought to the attention of the bank’s management and documented appropriately. 
Types of isolated or technical violations may include, but are not limited to: 
•Failure to file or late filing of CTRs that is infrequent, not consistent, or nonrecurring.
•Failure to obtain complete customer identification  information for a monetary instrument
sales transaction that is isolated and  infrequent.
•Infrequent, not consistent, or nonrecurring incomplete or inaccurate information in SAR
data fields.
•Failure to obtain or verify required customer identification information that is infrequent,
not consistent, or nonrecurring.
•Failure to complete a 314(a) information request that is inadvertent or nonrecurring.
In formulating a written conclusion, the examiner does not need to discuss every procedure performed during the examination.  During discussions with management about examination conclusions, examiners should include discussions of both strengths and weaknesses of the 
bank’s BSA/AML compliance.  Examiners should document all relevant determinations and 
conclusions.

Objective.  Formulate conclusions, communicate findings to management, prepare report 
comments, develop an appropriate supervisory response, and close the examination. 
Formulating Conclusions  
1.Accumulate all pertinent findings from the BSA/AML examination procedures
performed .  Evaluate the thoroughness and reliability of any risk assessment conducted
by the bank .  Reach a preliminary conclusion as to  whether the following requirements
are met:
•The BSA/AML compliance program is effectively monitored and supervised in
relation to the bank’ s risk profile  as determined by the risk assessment .  The examiner
should ascertain if the BSA/AML compliance program is effective in mitigating the
bank’s overall risk.
•The board of directors and senior management are aware of BSA/AML regulatory
requirements ; effectively oversee BSA/AML compliance, and commit, as necessary,
to corrective actions (e.g., audit and regulatory examinations).
•BSA/AML policies, procedures, and processes are adequate to ensure compliancewith applicable laws and regulations and appropriately address higher-risk operations
(products, services, customers, entities, and geographic locations).
•Internal controls ensure compliance with the BSA and provide sufficient risk
management, especially for higher-risk operations (products, services, customers,
entities, and geographic locations).
•Independent testing (audit) is appropriate and adequately tests for compliance with
required laws, regulations, and policies.  Overall audit coverage and frequency are
appropriate in relation to the risk profile of the bank.  Transaction testing is adequate,particularly for higher -risk banking operations and suspicious activity monitoring
systems.
•The designated person responsible for coordinating and monitoring day- to-day
compliance is competent and has the necessary resources.
•Personnel are sufficiently trained to adhere to legal, regulatory, and policy
requirements.
•Information and communication policies, procedures, and processes are adequate and
accurate.
All relevant determinations should be documented and explained.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  44 2/27/2015.V2  Determine the Underlying Cause  
2.Determine the underlying cause of policy, procedure, or process deficiencies , if
identified .  These deficiencies can be the result of a number of factors, including, but not
limited to , the following:
•Management has not assessed, or has not accurately assessed, the bank ’s BSA/AML
risks.
•Management is unaware of relevant issues.
•Management is unwilling to create or enhance policies, procedures, and processes.
•Management or employees disregard established policies, procedures, and processes.
•Management or employees are unaware of or misunderstand regulatory requirements,
policies, procedures, or processes.
•Higher -risk operations (products, services, customers, entities, and geographic
locations) have grown faster than the capabilities of the BSA/AML complianceprogram.
•Changes in internal policies, procedures, and processes are poor ly communicated.
3.Determine whether deficiencies or violations were previously identified by managementor audit or were only identified as a result of this examination.

•A conclusion regarding the adequacy of the BSA/AML compliance program and
whether it meets all the regulatory requirements by providing the following:
oA system of internal controls.
oIndependent testing for compliance.
oA specific person to coordinate and monitor the BSA/AML compliance program.
oTraining of appropriate personnel.
•A conclusion as to whether the written CIP is appropriate for the bank’s size,
location, and type of business.

5.Document your  conclusion regarding the adequacy of the bank’ s BSA/AML  compliance
program.  Discuss the effectiveness of each of these elements of the bank ’s BSA/AML
compliance program .  Indicate whether the BSA/AML compliance program meets all the
regulatory requirements by providing the following:
•A system of internal cont rols.
•Independent testing for compliance.
•A specific person to coordinate and monitor the BSA/AML compliance program.
•Training of appropriate personnel.
The BSA/AML compliance program must also include a written Customer Identification 
Program (CIP) approp riate for the bank’s size, location, and type of business. 
The examiner does not need to provide a written comment on every one of the 
following items 6 through 13.  Written comments should cover only areas or subjects 
pertinent to the examiner ’s findings and conclusions .  All  significant findings must be 
included in the ROE.  The examiner should ensure that workpapers are prepared in 
sufficient detail to support issues discussed in the ROE.  To the extent that the following items are discussed in the workpapers, but not the ROE, the examiner should ensure that the workpapers thoroughly and adequately document each review, as well as any other aspect of the bank ’s BSA/AML compliance program that merits attention, but may not 
rise to the level of being included in the ROE.  The examiner should organize and reference workpapers and document conclusions and supporting information within internal databases, as appropriate.  As applicable, the examiner should prepare a 
discussion of the following items. 
6.Describe w hether the bank ’s policies  and procedures for law enforcement requests for
information under section 314(a) of the USA PATRIOT  Act (31 CFR 1010.520) meet
regulatory requirements.
7. If the bank maintains any foreign correspondent or private banking accounts for non-U.S.
persons, describe whether the bank’s due diligence policies, procedures, and processes
meet regulatory requirements under section 312 of the USA PATRIOT  Act (31 CFR

Customer Identification Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  47 2/27/2015.V2  CORE EXAMINATION OVERVIEW AND 
PROCEDURES FOR REGUL ATORY 
REQUIREMENTS AND RELATED TOPICS  
Customer Identification Program — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements for 
the Customer Identification Program (CIP).  
All banks must have a written CIP.40 The CIP rule implements section 326 of the USA 
PATRIOT  Act and requires each bank to implement a written CIP that is appropriate for its 
size and type of business and that includes certain minimum requirements.  The CIP must be 
incorporated into the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program, which is subject to approval by the bank’s board of directors.
41 The implementation of a CIP by subsidiaries of banks is 
appropriate as a matter of safety and soundness and protection from reputational risks.  Domestic s ubsidiaries (other than functionally regulated subsidiaries subject to separate CIP 
rules ) of banks should comply with the CIP rule that applies to the parent bank when opening 
an account within the meaning of 31 CFR 1020.100).
42 
The CIP is intended to enable the bank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer.  The CIP must include account opening procedures that specify the identifying information that is  obtained from each customer.  It must also include reasonabl e 
and practical risk -based procedures for verifying the identity of each customer.  Banks should 
conduct a risk assessment of their customer base and product offerings, and in determining 
the risks, consider: 
•The types of accounts offered by the bank.
•The bank’s methods of opening accounts.
•The types of identifying information available.
•The bank’s size, location, and customer base, including types of products and services
used by customers in different geographic locations.
Pursuant to the CIP rule, an “account” is a formal banking relationship to provide or engage 
in services, dealings, or other financial transactions, and includes a deposit account, a transaction or asset account, a credit account, or another extension of credit.  An account also 
40 Refer to 12 CFR 208.63(b), 211.5(m), 211.24(j) (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) (Federal 
Reserve) ; 12 CFR 326.8(b) (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation)(FDIC); 12 CFR 748.2(b) (National Credit 
Union Administration) (NCUA) ; 12 CFR 21.21 (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency)(OCC) ; and 31 CFR 
1020.220 (FinCEN).  
41 As of the publication date of this manual, nonfederally regulated private banks, trust companies, and credit 
unions do not have BSA/AML co mpliance program requirements; however, the bank’s board must still approve 
the CIP.

Customer Identification Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  48 2/27/2015.V2  includes a relationship established to provide a safe deposit box or other safekeeping services 
or to provide cash management, custodian, or trust services. 
An account does not include: 
•Products or services for which a formal banking relationship is not established with a
person, such as check cashing, funds transfer, or the sale of a check or money order.
•Any account that the bank acquires .  This may include single or multiple accounts as a
result of a purchase of assets, acquisition, merger, or assumption of li abilities.
•Accounts opened to participate in an employee benefit plan established under theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
The CIP rule applies to a “customer. ” A customer is  a “person” (an individual, a corporation, 
partnership, a trust, an estate, or any other entity recognized as a legal person) who opens a new account, an individual who opens a new account for another individual who lacks legal capacity, and an individual who opens a new account for an entity that is not a legal person (e.g., a civic club) .  A customer does not include a person who does not receive banking 
services, such as a person whose loan application is denied.
43 The definition of “ customer ” 
also does not include an existing customer as long as the bank has a reason able belief that it 
knows the customer’ s true identity.44 Excluded from the definition of customer are federally 
regulated banks, banks regulated by a state bank regulator, governmental entities, and 
publicly traded companies (as described in 31 CFR 1020.315(b)(1) through (4). 
Customer Information Required  
The CIP must contain account-opening procedures detailing the identifying information that 
must be obtained from each customer.45 At a minimum, the bank must obtain the following 
identifying information fro m each customer before opening the account:46 
•Name.
43 When the account is a loan, the account is considered to be “opened” when the bank enters into an 
enforceable agreement to provide a loan to the customer.  
44 The bank may demonstrate that it knows an existing customer’s true identity by showing that before the 
issuance of the final CIP rule, it had comparable procedures in place to verify the identity of persons who had 
accounts with the bank as of October 1, 2003, though the bank may not have gathered the very same 
information about such persons as required by the final CIP rule.  Alternative means include showing that the 
bank has had an active and longstanding relationship with a particular person, as eviden ced by such things as a 
history of account statements sent to the person, information sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about 
the person’s accounts without issue, loans made and repaid, or other services performed for the person over a period of t ime.  However, the comparable procedures used to verify the identity detailed above might not 
suffice for persons that the bank has deemed to be higher risk.  
45 When an individual opens a new account for an entity that is not a legal person or for another individual who 
lacks legal capacity, the identifying information for the individual opening the account must be obtained.  In 
contrast, when an account is opened by an agent on behalf of another person, the bank must obtain the identifying information of t he person on whose behalf the account is being opened. 
46 For credit card customers, the bank may obtain identifying information from a third -party source before 
extending credit.

ased on its risk assessment, a bank may require identifying information in addition to the 
items above for certain customers or product lines.  
Customer Verification  
The CIP must contain risk-based procedures for verifying the identity of the customer within 
a reasonable period of time after the account is opened .  The verification procedures must use 
“the information obtained in accordance with [ 31 CFR 1020.220] paragraph (a)(2)(i),” 
namely the identifying information obtained by the bank .  A bank need not establish the 
accuracy of every element of identifying information obtained, but it must verify enough information to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of the customer .  The 
bank’s procedures must describe when it uses documents, nondocumentary methods, or a 
combination of both. 
Verification Through Documents  
A bank using documentary methods to verify a customer’s identity must have procedures that 
set forth the minimum acceptable documentation .  The CIP rule gives examples of types of 
documents that have long been considered primary sources of identification.  The rule reflects the federal banking agencies ’ expectatio ns that banks review an unexpired 
government- issued form of identification from most customers .  This identification must 
provide evidence of a customer’s nationality or residence and bear a photograph or similar safeguard; examples include a driver’ s lice nse or passport.  However, other forms of 
identification may be used if they enable the bank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of the customer .  Nonetheless, given the availability of counterfeit and 
fraudulently obtained documents, a bank is encouraged to review more than a single 
document to ensure that it has a reasonable belief that it knows the customer’ s true identity.  
For a “person” other than an individual (such as a corporation, partnership, or trust), the bank 
should obta in documents showing the legal existence of the entity, such as certified articles 
of incorporation, an unexpired government-issued business license, a partnership agreement, or a trust instrument.  
47 For an individual: a residential or business street address, or if the indi vidual does not have such an address, 
an Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number, the residential or business street address of 
next of kin or of another contact individual, or a description of the customer’s physical location.  For a “person” 
other than an individual (such as a corporation, partnership, or trust): a principal place of business, local office, 
or other physical location.  
48 An identification number for a U.S. person is a taxpayer identification number (TIN) (or evidence o f an 
application for one), and an identification number for a non -U.S. person is one or more of the following: a TIN; 
a passport number and country of issuance; an alien identification card number; or a number and country of 
issuance of any other unexpired  government -issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a 
photograph or similar safeguard.  TIN is defined by section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 
USC 6109) and the IRS regulations implementing that section (e.g., Socia l Security number (SSN), individual 
taxpayer identification number (ITIN), or employer identification number).

Customer Identification Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  50 2/27/2015.V2  Verification Through Nondocumentary Methods  
Banks are not required to use nondocumentary methods to verify a customer’ s identity .  
However, a bank using nondocumentary methods to verify a customer’ s identity must have 
procedures that set forth the methods the bank uses.  Nondocumentary methods may include 
contact ing a customer; independently verifying the customer’s identity through the 
comparison of information provided by the customer with information obtained from a consumer reporting agency, public database, or other source; checking references with other 
financial institutions; and obtaining a financial statement.  
The bank’s nondocumentary procedures must also address the following situations: An 
individual is unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification document that bears a photograph or s imilar safeguard; the bank is not familiar with the documents 
presented; the account is opened without obtaining documents (e.g., the bank obtains the required information from the customer with the intent to verify it); the customer opens the account with out appearing in person; or the bank is otherwise presented with circumstances 
that increase the risk that it will be unable to verify the true identity of a customer through 
documents. 
Additional Verification for Certain Customers  
The CIP must address situations where, based on its risk assessment of a new account opened 
by a customer that is not an individual, the bank obtains information about individuals with authority or control over such accounts, including signatories, in order to verify the customer ’s identity .  This verification method applies only when the bank cannot verify the 
customer ’s true identity using documentary or nondocumentary methods.  For example, a 
bank may need to obtain information about and verify the identity of a sole proprietor or the principals in a partnership when the bank cannot otherwise satisfactorily identify the sole 
proprietorship or the partnership. 
Lack of Verification  
The CIP must also have procedures for circumstances in which the bank cannot form a 
reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of the customer .  These procedures should 
describe:  
•Circumstances in which the bank should not open an account.
•The terms under which a customer may use an account while the bank attempts to verifythe customer ’s identity.
•When the bank should close an account, after attempts to verify a customer’ s identity
have failed.
•When the bank should file a SAR in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
Recordkeeping and Retention  Requirements 
A bank’ s CIP must include recordkeeping procedures .  At a minimum, the bank must retain 
the identifying information (name, address, date of birth for an individual, TIN, and any other information required by the CIP) obtained at account opening for a period of five years after 
--- Page 56 ---
Customer Identification Program — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  51 2/27/2015.V2  the account is closed.49  For credit cards, the retention period is five years after the account 
closes or becomes dormant. 
The bank must also keep a description of the following for five years after the record was 
made:  
•Any document that was relied on to verify identity, noting the type of document, the
identification number, the place of issuance, and, if any, the date of issuance and
expiration date.
•The method and the results of any measures undertaken to verify identity.
•The results of any substantive discr epancy discovered when verifying identity.
Comparison With Government Lists  
The CIP must include procedures for determining whether the customer appears on any 
federal government list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations. Banks are  
contacted by the U.S. Treasury in consultation with their federal banking agency when a list is issued .  At such time, banks must compare customer names against the list within a 
reasonable time of account opening or earlier, if required by the government, and they must 
follow any directives that accompany the list.  
As of the publication date of this manual, there are no designated government lists to verify 
specifically for CIP purposes.  Customer comparisons to Office of Foreign Assets Control lists and 31 CFR 1010.520 (commonly referred to as section 314(a) requests) remain separate 
and distinct requirements.   
Adequate Customer Notice  
The CIP must include procedures for providing customers with adequate notice that the bank is requesting information to verify their identities .  The notice must generally describe the 
bank’s identification requirements and be provided in a manner that is reasonably designed to allow a customer to view it or otherwise receive the notice before the account is opened .  
Exampl es include posting the notice in the lobby, on a Web site, or within loan application 
documents.  Sample language is provided in the regulation: 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT — To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money 
laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and 
49 A bank may keep photocopies of identifying documents that it uses to verify a customer’s identity; however, 
the CIP regulation does not requir e it.  A bank’s verification procedures should be risk- based and, in certain 
situations, keeping copies of identifying documents may be warranted.  In addition, a bank may have 
procedures to keep copies of the documents for other purposes, for example, to facilitate investigating potential 
fraud.  However, if a bank does choose to retain photocopies of identifying documents, it should ensure that 
these photocopies are physically secured to adequately protect against possible identity theft.  (These document s 
should be retained in accordance with the general recordkeeping requirements in 31  CFR 1010.430.  
Nonetheless, a bank should be mindful that it must not improperly use any documents containing a picture of an individual, such as a driver’s license, in co nnection with any aspect of a credit transaction.  Refer to Frequently 
Asked Questions Related to Customer Identification Program Rules  issued by FinCEN, Federal Reserve, FDIC , 
NCUA , OCC, and OTS , April 28, 2005.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  52 2/27/2015.V2  record information that identifies each person who opens an account.  What this means 
for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you .  We may also ask to see your 
driver’s license or other identifying documents. 
Reliance on Another Financial Institution  
A bank is permitted to rely on another financial institution (including an affiliate) to perform some or all of the elements of the CIP, if reliance is addressed in the CIP and the following 
criteria are met:  
•The relied -upon financial institution is subject to a rule implementing the AML program
require ments of 31 USC 5318(h) and is regulated by a federal functional regulator.
50
•T
he customer has an account or is opening an account at the bank and at the other
functionally regulated institution.
•Reliance is reasonable, under the circumstances.
•The other fi nancial institution enters into a contract requiring it to certify annually to the
bank that it has implemented its AML program, and that it will perform (or its agent willperform) the specified requirements of the bank’ s CIP.
Use of Third Parties 
The CIP rule does not alter a bank’s authority to use a third party, such as an agent or service 
provider, to perform services on its behalf.  Therefore, a bank is permitted to arrange for a 
third party, such as a car dealer or mortgage broker, acting as its agen t in connection with a 
loan, to verify the identity of its customer .  The bank can also arrange for a third party to 
maintain its records .  However, as with any other responsibility performed by a third party, 
the bank is ultimately responsible for that th ird party’ s compliance with the requirements of 
the bank’ s CIP .  As a result, banks should establish adequate controls and review procedures 
for such relationships.  This requirement contrasts with the reliance provision of the rule that 
permits the relied -upon party to take responsibility. 
Other Legal Requirements  
Nothing in the CIP rule relieves a bank of its obligations under any provision of the BSA or 
other AML laws, rules, and regulations, particularly with respect to provisions concerning information  that must be obtained, verified, or maintained in connection with any account or 
transaction.  
The U.S. Treasury and the federal banking agencies have provided banks with Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), which may be revised periodically.  The FAQs and other related documents (e.g., the CIP rule) are available on FinCEN ’s and the federal banking agencies’ 
Web sites.  
50 Federal functional regulator means: Federal Reserve, FDIC,  NCUA,  OCC,  U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), or U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Customer Identification Program — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  53 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Customer Identification Program  
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements for 
the Customer Identification Program (CIP). 
1.Verify that the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes include a comprehensive
program for identifying customers who open an account after October 1, 2003.  The
written program must be included within the bank’s BSA/AML compliance program and
must include, at a minimum, policies, procedures, and processes for the following:
Identification of information required to be obtained (including name , address, taxpayer
identification number (TIN), and date of birth, for individuals), and risk-based identity
verification procedures (including procedures that address situations in which verification
cannot be performed).
•Procedures for complying with re cordkeeping requirements.
•Procedures for checking new accounts against prescribed government lists, if
applicable.
•Procedures for providing adequate customer notice.
•Procedures covering the bank’ s reliance on another financial institution or a third
party,  if applicable.
•Procedures for determining whether and when a SAR should be filed.
2.Determine whether the bank ’s CIP considers the types of accounts offered; methods of
account opening; and the bank’s size, location, and customer base.
3.Determine whether the bank ’s policy for opening new accounts for existing customers
appears reasonable.
4. Review board minutes and verify that the board of directors approved the CIP, either
separately or as part of the BSA/AML compliance program ( 31 CFR 1020.220(a)(1)).
5.Evaluate the bank ’s audit and training programs to ensure that the CIP is adequately
incorporated ( 31 CFR 1020.220(a)(1)).
6.Evaluate the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes for verifying that all new
accounts are checked against prescribed go vernment lists for suspected terrorists or
terrorist organizations on a timely basis, if such lists are issued ( 31 CFR 1020.220(a)(4)).
Transaction Testing  
7. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
a
udit findings, select a sample of new accounts opened since the most recent examination
to review for compliance with the bank’ s CIP .  The sample should include a cross- section
of accounts (e.g., consumers and businesses, loans and deposits, credit card relationships,
and Internet accounts).  The sample should also include the following:
--- Page 59 ---
Customer Identification Program — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  54 2/27/2015.V2  •Accounts opened for a customer that provides an application for a TIN or accounts
opened with incomplete verification procedures.
•New accounts opened using documentary methods and new accounts opened using
nondocumentary methods.
•Accounts identified as higher risk.51
•A
ccounts opened by existing higher -risk customers.
•Accounts opened with exceptions.
•Accounts opened by a third party (e.g., indirect loans).
8. From the previous sample of new accounts, determine whether the bank has performed
the following procedures:
•Opened the account in accordance with the requirements of the CIP (31 CFR
1020.220(a)(1)).
•Formed a reasonable belief as to the true identity of a customer, including a hi gher-
risk customer.  (The bank should already have a reasonable belief as to the identity of
an existing customer ( 31 CFR 1020.220 (a)(2)).
•Obtained from each customer, before opening the account, the identity information
required by the CIP (31 CFR 1020.220(a) (2)(i)) (e.g., name, date of birth, address,
and identification number).
•Within a reasonable time after account opening, verified enough of the customer’ s
identity information to form a reasonable belief as to the customer ’s true identity ( 31
CFR 1020.220(a)(2)(ii)).
•Appropriately resolved situations in which customer identity could not be reasonably
established ( 31 CFR 1020.220(a)(2)(iii)).
•Maintained a record of the identity information required by the CIP, the method used
to verify identity, and verification results (including results of discrepancies ) (31 CFR
1020.220(a)(3)).
•Compared the customer’s name against the list of known or suspected terrorists or
terrorist organizations, if applicable ( 31 CFR 1020.220(a)(4)).
•Filed SARs, as appropriate.
9.Evaluate the level of CIP exceptions to determine whether the bank is effectivelyimplementing its CIP .  A bank’s policy may not allow staff to make or approve CIP
exceptions .  However, a bank may exclude isolated, nonsystemic errors (such as an
insig nificant number of data entry errors ) from CIP requirements without compromising
the effectiveness of its CIP  (31 CFR 1020.220(a)(1).
51 Higher -risk accounts, for CIP purposes, may include accounts in which identification verif ication is typically 
more difficult (e.g., foreign private banking and trust accounts, accounts of senior foreign political figures, 
offshore accounts, and out -of-area and non -face-to-face accounts).  
--- Page 60 ---
Customer Identification Program — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  55 2/27/2015.V2  10. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
au
dit, select a sample of relationships with third parties the bank relies on to perform its
CIP (or portions of its CIP), if applicable .  If the bank is using the “reliance provision”:
•Determine whether the third party is a federally regulated institution subject to a final
rule i mplementing the AML program requirements of 31 USC 5318(h).
•Review the contract between the parties, annual certifications, and other information,such as the third party’ s CIP ( 31 CFR 1020.220(a)(6)).
•Determine whether reliance is reasonable.  The contract and certification provide a
standard means for a bank to demonstrate that it has satisfied the “reliance provision,”
unless the examiner has reason to believe that the bank ’s reliance is not reasonable
(e.g., the third party has been subject to an enforcement action for AML or BSA
deficiencies or violations).
11. If the bank is using an agent or service provider to perform elements of its CIP, determine
whether the bank has established appropriate internal controls and review procedures to
ensure that its  CIP is being implemented for third -party agent or service-provider
relationships (e.g., car dealerships).
12.Review the adequacy of the bank ’s customer notice and the timing of the notice ’s
delivery ( 31 CFR 1020.220(a)(5)).
13.Evaluate the bank ’s CIP re cord retention policy and ensure that it corresponds to the
regulatory requirements to maintain certain records .  The bank must retain the identity
information obtained at account opening for five years after the account closes.  The bankmust also maintain a description of documents relied on, methods used to verify identity,and resolution of discrepancies for five years after the record is made ( 31 CFR
1020.220(a)(3) (ii)).
14. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testin g, form a
conclusion about the ability of policies, procedures, and processes to meet regulatory
requirements associated with CIP.

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  60 2/27/2015.V2  Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes, and overall compliance 
with statutory and regulatory requirements for monitoring, detecting, and reporting 
suspicious activities.  
Suspicious activity reporting forms the cornerstone of the BSA reporting system.  It is critical 
to the United States ’ ability to utilize financial information to combat terrorism, terrorist 
financing, money laundering, and other financial crimes .  Examiners and banks should 
recognize that the quality of SAR content is critical to the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
suspicious activity reporting system.  
Within this system, FinCEN and the federal banking agencies recognize that, as a practical 
matter, it is not possible for a bank to detect and report all potentially illicit transactions that flow through the bank.  Examiners should focus on evaluating a bank’s policies, procedures, and processes to identify , evaluate,  and report  susp icious activity .  However, as part of the 
examination process, examiners should review individual SAR filing decisions to determine the effectiveness of the bank’s suspicious activity identification, evaluation,  and reporting 
process .  Banks, bank holding companies, and their subsidiaries are required by federal 
regulations
53 to file a SAR with respect to:  
•Criminal violations involving insider abuse in any amount.
•Criminal violations aggregating $5,000 or more when a suspect can be identified.
•Criminal viola tions aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of a potential suspect.
•Transactions conducted or attempted by, at, or through the bank (or an affiliate) and
aggregating $5,000 or more, if the bank or affiliate knows, suspects, or has reason to
suspect that t he transaction:
–May involve potential money laundering or other illegal activity (e.g., terrorismfinancing).

Safe Harbor for Banks From Civil Liability for Suspicious Activity 
Reporting  
Federal law (31 USC 5318(g)(3)) provides protection from civil liability for all reports of 
suspicious transactions made to appropriate authorities, including supporting documentation, regardless of whether such reports are filed pursuant to the SAR instructions.  Specifically, the law provides that a bank and its directors, officers, employees, and agents that make a disclosure to the appropriate authorities of any possible violation of law or regulation, including a disclosure in connection with the preparation of SARs, “ shall not be liable to any 
person under any law or regulation of the United States, any constitution, law, or regulation of any State or political subdivision of any State, or under any contract or other legally 
enforceable agreement (including any arbitration agreement), for such disclosure or for any failure to provide notice of such disclosure to the person who is the subject of such disclosure or any other person identified in the disclosure.” The safe harbor applies to SARs filed within the required reporting thresholds as well as to SARs filed voluntarily on any activity below 
the threshold.

Systems to Identify,  Research,  and Report 
Suspicious Activity  
Suspicious activity monitoring and reporting are  critical internal controls.  Proper monitoring 
and reporting processes are essential to ensuring that the bank has an adequate and effective 
BSA compliance program .  Appropriate policies, procedures, and processes should be in 
place to monitor and identify unusual activity.  The sophistication  of monitoring systems 
should be dictated by the bank’ s risk  profile , with particular emphasis on the composition of 
higher- risk products, services, customers, entities, and geographies .  The bank should ensure 
adequate staff is assigned to the identification, research, and reporting of suspicious 
activities , taking into account the bank’s overall risk profile and the volume of transactions.  
Monitoring systems typically include employee identification or referrals, transaction -based 
(manual) systems, surveillance (automated) systems , or any combination of these. 
Generally, effective suspicious activity monitoring and reporting syst ems include five key 
components (refer to Appendix S “Key Suspicious Activity Monitoring Components ”).  The 
components, listed below, are interdependent, and an effective suspicious activity monitoring 
and reporting process should include successful implementation of each component.  Breakdowns in any one or more of these components may adversely affect  SAR reporting 
and BSA compliance.  The f ive key components to an effective monitoring and reporting 
system are:  
56 The agencies incorporated the statutory expansion of the safe harbor by cross -referencing section 
5318(g)  in their SAR regulations .  The OCC and Fi nCEN amended their SAR regulations  to make clear 
that the safe harbor also applies to a disclosure by a bank made jointly with another financial institution for 
purposes of filing a joint SAR  (see 12 CFR 21.11(l) and 31 CFR 1020.320(e)), respectively.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  62 2/27/2015.V2  •Identification or alert of unusual activity (which may include: employee identification,
law enforcement inquiries, other referrals, and transaction and surveillance monitoring
system  output ).
•Managing alerts.
•SAR decision making.
•SAR completion and filing.
•Monitoring and SAR filing on continuing activity.
These components are present in banks of all sizes.  However, the structure and formality of 
the components may vary .  Larger banks typically have greater differentiation and distinction 
between functions, and may devote entire departments to the completion of each component.  Smaller banks may use one or more employees to complete several tasks (e.g., review of monitoring reports, research activity, and completion of the actual SAR).  Policies, procedures, and processes should describe the steps the bank takes to address each component and indicate the person(s) or departments responsible for identifying or producing an alert of unusual activity, managing the alert, deciding whether to file, SAR completion 
and filing, and monitoring and SAR filing on continuing activity.  
Identification of Unusual Activity 
Banks use a number of methods to identify potentially suspicious activity, including but not 
limited to activity identified by employees during day -to-day operations, law enforcement 
inquiries, or requests, such as those typically seen in section 314(a) and section 314(b) 
requests, advisories issued by regulatory or law enforcement agencies, transaction and 
surveillance monitoring system output, or any combination of these. 
Employee Identification 
During the course of day- to-day operations, employees may observe unusual or potentially 
suspicious transaction activity.  Banks should implement appropriate training, policies, and 
procedures to ensure that personnel adhere to the internal processes for identification and referral of potentially suspicious activity.  Banks should be aware of all methods of identification and should ensure that their suspicious activity monitoring system includes processes to facilitate the transfer  of internal referrals to appropriate personnel for further 
research.  
Law Enforcement Inquiries and Requests  
Banks should establish policies, procedures, and processes for identifying subjects of law enforcement requests, monitoring the transaction activity of those subjects when appropriate, identifying unusual or potentially suspicious activity related to those subjects, and filing, as appropriate, SARs related to those subjects.  Law enforcement inquiries and requests can 
include grand jury subpoenas, Na tional Security Letters (NSL ), and section 314(a) requests.

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  63 2/27/2015.V2  Mere receipt of any law enforcement inquiry does not, by itself, require the filing of a SAR 
by the bank .  Nonetheless, a law enforcement inquiry may be relevant to a bank’s overall risk 
assessme nt of its customers and accounts.  For example, the receipt of a grand jury subpoena 
should cause a bank to review account activity for the relevant customer.58 A bank should 
assess all of the information it knows about its customer, including the receipt of a law 
enforcement inquiry, in accordance with its risk- based BSA/AML compliance program.  
The bank should determine whether a SAR should be filed based on all customer information 
available.  Due  to the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings, if a bank files a SAR after 
receiving a grand jury subpoena, law enforcement discourages banks from including any reference to the receipt or existence of the grand jury subpoena in the SAR .  Rather, the SAR 
should reference only those facts and activities that support a finding of suspicious 
transactions identified by the bank. 
National Security Letters  
NSLs are written investigative demands that may be issued by the local Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and other federal governmental authorities in counteri ntelligence and 
counterterrorism investigations to obtain the following: 
•Telephone and electronic communications records from telephone companies and
Internet service providers.59
•I
nformation from credit bureaus.60
•F
inancial records from financial institutio ns.61
N
SLs are highly confidential documents ; for that reason, examiners do not review or sample 
specific NSLs .62 Pursuant to 12 USC 3414(a)(3) and (5)(D), no bank, or officer, employee or 
agent of the institution, can disclose to any person that a government authority or the FBI has sought or obtained access to records through a Right to Financial Privacy Act NSL.  Banks that receive NSLs must take appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality of the letters and should have procedures in place for proce ssing and maintaining the confidentiality of 
NSLs.  
If a bank files a SAR after receiving a NSL, the SAR should not contain any reference to the receipt or existence of the NSL .  The SAR should reference only those facts and activities 
that support a finding of unusual or suspicious transactions identified by the bank. 
Questions regarding NSLs should be directed to the bank’ s local FBI field office .  Contact

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  64 2/27/2015.V2  Transaction Monitoring (Manual Transaction Monitoring ) 
A transaction monitoring system, sometimes referred to as a  manual transaction monitoring 
system, typically target s specific types of transaction s (e.g. , those involving large amounts of 
cash, those to  or from foreign geographies) and includes a manual  review of various reports 
generated by the bank ’s MIS or vendor systems in order to identify unusual activity .  
Examples of MIS reports include currency activity reports, funds transfer reports, monetary 
instrument sales reports, large item reports, significant balance change reports, ATM 
transaction reports, and no nsufficient funds (NSF) reports.  Many MIS or vendor systems 
include filtering models for identification of potentially unusual activity .  The process may 
involve review of daily reports, reports that cover a period of time (e.g., rolling 30- day 
reports, monthly reports), or a combination of both types of reports.  The type and frequency of reviews and resulting reports used should be commensurat e with the bank ’s BSA/AML 
risk profile and appropriately cover its higher -risk products, services, customers, entities, and 
geographic locations. 
MIS or vendor system-generated reports typically use a discretionary dollar threshold.  
Thresholds selected by  management for the production of transaction reports should enable 
management to detect unusual activity .  Upon identification of unusual activity, assigned 
personnel should review CDD and other pertinent information to determine whether the activity is s uspicious.  Management should periodically evaluate the appropriateness of 
filtering criteria and thresholds used in the monitoring process.  Each bank should evaluate and identify filtering criteria most appropriate for their bank .  The  programming of the 
bank’s monitoring systems should be independently reviewed for reasonable filtering criteria.  
Typical transaction monitoring reports are as follows.  
Currency activity reports .  Most vendors offer reports that identify all currency activity or 
currency activity greater than $10,000.  These reports assist bankers with filing CTRs  and 
identifying suspicious currency activity .  Most bank information service providers offer 
currency activity reports that can filter transactions using various parameters, for example:  
•Currency activity including multiple transactions greater than $10,000.
•Currency activity (single and multiple transactions) below the $10,000 reportingrequirement (e.g., between $7,000 and $10,000).
•Currency transactions involving multiple lower dollar transactions (e.g., $3,000) that over
a period of time (e.g., 15 days) aggregate to a substantial sum of money (e.g., $30,000).
•Currency transactions aggregated by customer name, taxpayer identification number, or
customer information file number.
Such filtering reports, whether implemented through a purchased vendor software system or 
through requests from information service providers, significantly enhance a bank’ s ability to 
identify and evaluate unusual currency transactions.  
Funds transfer records .  The BSA requires banks to maintain records of funds transfer in 
amounts of $3,000 and above.  Periodic review of this information can assist banks in identifying patterns of unusual activity .  A periodic review of the funds transfer records in 
banks with low funds transfer activity is usually sufficient to identify unusual activity .  For 
--- Page 70 ---
Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  65 2/27/2015.V2  banks with more significant funds transfer activity, use of spreadsheet or vendor software is 
an efficient way to review funds transfer activity for unusual patterns.  Most vendor software systems include standard suspicious activity filter reports .  These reports typically focus on 
identifying certain higher-risk geographic locations and larger dollar funds transfer 
transactions for individuals and businesses.  Each bank should establish its own filtering 
criteria for both individuals and businesses.  Noncustomer funds transfer transactions and payable upon proper identification (PUPID) transactions should be reviewed for unusual activity .  Activities identified durin g these reviews should be subjected to additional research 
to ensure that identified activity is consistent with the stated account purpose and expected activity .  When inconsistencies are identified, banks may need to conduct a global 
relationship review to determine if a SAR is warranted . 
Monetary instrument records .  Records for monetary instrument sales are required by the 
BSA .  Such records can assist the bank in identifying possible currency structuring through 
the purchase of cashier ’s checks, offici al bank checks, money orders, or traveler’ s checks in 
amounts of $3,000 to $10,000.  A periodic review of these records can also help identify frequent purchasers of monetary instruments and common payees.  Reviews for suspicious activity should encompass activity for an extended period of time (30, 60, 90 days) and should focus on, among other things, identification of commonalities, such as common 
payees  and purchasers, or consecutively numbered purchased monetary instruments. 
Surveillance Monitoring ( Automated Account Monitoring) 
A surveillance monitoring system, sometimes referred to as an automated account monitoring 
system, can cover multiple types of transactions and use various rules to identify potentially suspicious activity.  In addition, many can  adapt over time based on historical activity, 
trends, or internal peer comparison.  These systems typically use computer programs, developed in-house or purchased from vendors, to identify individual transactions, patterns of unusual activity, or deviations from expected activity .  These systems can capture a wide 
range of account activity, such as deposits, withdrawals, funds transfers, automated clearing house (ACH) transactions, and automated teller machine (ATM) transactions, directly from the bank’ s core data processing system .  Banks that are large, operate in many locations, or 
have a large volume of higher-risk customers typically use surveillance monitoring systems.  
Surveillance monitoring systems include rule-based and intelligent systems.  Rule-based 
systems detect unusual transactions that are outside of system-developed or management-established “rules. ” Such systems can consist of few or many rules, depending on the 
complexity of the in -house or vendor product.  These rules are applied using a series of 
transaction filters or a rules engine.  Rule- based systems are more sophisticated than the 
basic manual system, which only filters on one rule (e.g., transaction greater than $10,000).  Rule- based systems can apply multiple rules, overlapping rules, and filters  that are more 
complex .  For example, rule- based systems can initially apply a rule, or set of criteria to all 
accounts  within a bank (e.g., all retail customers) , and then apply a more refined set of 
criteria to a subset of accounts or risk  category of accounts ( e.g., all retail customers with 
direct deposits).  Rule- based systems can also filter  against  individual customer-account 
profiles.  
--- Page 71 ---
Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  66 2/27/2015.V2  Intelligent systems are adaptive and can filter transactions, based  on historical account 
activity or compare customer activity against a pre -established peer group or other relevant 
data.  Intelligent systems review transactions in context with other transactions and the 
customer profile.  In doing so, these systems increase their information database on the 
customer, account type, category, or business, as more transactions and data are stored in the 
system.  
Relative to surveillance monitoring, system capabilities and thresholds refer to the 
parameters or filters used by banks in their monitoring process es.  Parameters and filters 
should be reasonable and tailored to the activity that the bank is trying to identify or control.  After parameters and filters have been developed, they should be reviewed before implementation to identify any gaps (common mone y laundering techniques or frauds) that 
may not have been addressed.  For example, a bank may discover that its filter for cash structuring is triggered only by a daily cash transaction in excess of $10,000.  The bank may need to refine this filter in order to avoid missing potentially suspicious activity because common cash structuring techniques often involve transactions that are slightly under the 
CTR threshold.   
Once established, the bank should review and test system capabilities and thresholds on a 
periodic basis.  This review should focus on specific parameters or filter s in order to ensure 
that intended information is accurately captured and that the parameter or filter is appropriate 
for the bank’s particular risk profile. 
Understanding the filter ing criteria of a surveillance monitoring system is critical to assessing 
the effectiveness of the system .  System filtering criteria should be developed through a 
review of specific higher -risk products and services, customers and entities, and geographies.  
System filtering criteria, including specific profiles and rules, should be based on what is 
reasonable and expected for each type of account .  Monitoring accounts purely based on 
historical activity can be misleading if the activity is not actually consistent with similar 
types of accounts.  For example, an account  may have a historical transaction activity that is 
substantially different from what would normally be expected from that type of account (e.g., a check -cashing business that deposits large sums of currency versus withdrawing currency 
to fund the cashing of checks). 
The authority to establish or change expected activity profiles should be clearly defined 
through policies and procedures.  Controls should ensure limited access to the monitoring systems, and changes should generally require the approval of the BSA compliance officer or 
senior management .  Management should document and  be able to explain filtering criteria, 
thresholds used, and how both are appropriate for the bank’ s risks.  Management should also 
periodically review and test the filtering criteria and thresholds established to ensure that they 
are still effective .  In addition, the monitoring system’s programming methodology and 
effectiveness should be independently validated to ensure that the models are detecting 
potentially suspicious activity.  The independent validation should also verify the policies in 
place and that management is complying with those policies.

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  67 2/27/2015.V2  Managing A lerts 
Alert management focuses on processes used to investigate and evaluate identified unusual 
activity .  Banks should be aware of all methods of identification and should ensure that their 
suspicious activity monitoring program includes processes to eval uate any unusual activity 
identified, regardless of the method of identification.  Banks should have policies, 
procedures, and processes in place for referring unusual activity from all areas of the bank or business lines to the personnel or department responsible for evaluating unusual activity.  Within those procedures, management should establish a clear and defined escalation process 
from the point of initial detection to disposition of the investigation.  
The bank should assign adequate staff to the identification, evaluation, and reporting of 
potentially suspicious activities, taking into account the bank’s overall risk profile and the volume of transactions.  Additionally, a bank should ensure that the assigned staff possess the requisite experience levels and are provided with comprehensive and ongoing training to maintain their expertise .  Staff should also be provided with sufficient internal and external 
tools to allow them to properly research activities and formulate conclusions. 
Internal research  tools include, but are not limited to, access to account systems and account 
information, including CDD and EDD information.  CDD and EDD information assist banks 
in evaluating if the unusual activity is considered suspicious.  For additional information, refer to the core overview section , “Customer Due Diligence ,” page  56.  External research 
tools may include widely available Internet media search tools, as well those accessible by 
subscription.  After thorough research and analysis, investigators should document 
conclusions including any recommendation regarding whether or not to fil e a SAR.  
When multiple departments are responsible for researching unusual activities (i.e. , the BSA 
department researches BSA -related activity and the Fraud department researches fraud -
related activity), the lines of communication between the departments must remain open .  
This allows banks with bifurcated processes to gain efficiencies by sharing information, 
reducing  redundancies, and ensuring all suspicious activity is identified, evaluated,  and 
reported. 
If applicable, reviewing and understanding suspicious activity monitoring across the 
organizations’ affiliates, subsidiaries, and business lines may enhance a banki ng 
organization’s ability to detect suspicious activity , and thus minimize the potential for 
financial losses, increased legal or compliance expenses, and reputational risk to the organization.  Refer to the expanded overview section, “BSA/AML Compliance P rogram 
Structure s,” page 155, for further guidance.  
Identifying Underlying Crime  
Banks are required to report suspicious activity that may involve money laundering, BSA violations, terrorist financing,
63 and certain other crimes above prescribed dollar thresholds.  
63 If a bank knows, suspec ts, or has reason to suspect that a customer may be linked to terrorist activity against 
the United States, the bank should immediately call FinCEN’s Financial Institutions terrorist hot line toll -free 
number  (866) 556-3974.  Similarly, if any other suspec ted violation — such as an ongoing money laundering 
--- Page 73 ---
Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  68 2/27/2015.V2  However, banks are not obligated to investigate or confirm the underlying crime (e.g., 
terrorist financing, money laundering, tax evasion, identity theft, and various types of fraud).  Investig ation is the responsibility of law enforcement.  When evaluating suspicious activity 
and completing the SAR, banks should, to the best of their ability, identify the characteristics of the suspicious activity .  Suspicious Activity Information, Part II of the SAR provides a 
number of categories with different types of suspicious activity.  Within each category, there 
is the option of selecting “Other” if none of the suspicious activities apply.  However, the use of “Other” should be limited to situations that cannot be broadly identified within the 
categories provided. 
SAR Decision  Making 
After thorough research and analysis has been completed, findings are typically forwarded to 
a final decision maker (individual or committee) .  The bank should have policies, procedures, 
and processes for referring unusual activity from all business lines to the personnel or department responsible for evaluating unusual activity.  Within those procedures, management should establish  a clear and defined escalation process from  the point of initial 
detection to disposition of the investigation. 
The decision maker, whether an individual or committee, should have the authority to make 
the final SAR filing decision .  When the bank uses a committee, there should be a clearly 
defined  process to resolve differences of opinion on filing decisions.  Banks should document 
SAR decisions, including the specific reason for filing or not filing a SAR.  Thorough documentation provides a record of the SAR decision-making process, including fina l 
decisions not to file a SAR.  However, due to the variety of systems used to identify, track, and report suspicious activity, as well as the fact that each suspicious activity reporting decision is  based on unique facts and circumstances, no single form of documentation is 
required when a bank decides not to file.
64 
The decision to file a SAR is an inherently subjective judgment.  Examiners should focus on 
whether the bank has an effective SAR decisi on-making process, not individual SAR 
decisions.  Examiners may review individual SAR decisions as a means to test the effectiveness of the SAR monitoring, reporting, and decision-making process.  In those instances where the bank has an established SAR de cision -making process, has followed 
existing policies, procedures, and processes, and has determined not to file a SAR, the bank should not be criticized for the failure to file a SAR unless the failure is significant or 
accompanied by evidence of bad fait h.
65 
SAR Filing on Continuing Activity  
One purpose of filing SARs is to identify violations or potential violations of law to the 
appropriate law enforcement authorities for criminal investigation .  This objective is 
scheme — requires immediate attention, the bank should notify the appropriate federal banking and law 
enforcement agencies.  In either case, the bank must also file a SAR.

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  69 2/27/2015.V2  accomplished by the filing of a SAR that identifies the activity of concern .  If this activity 
continues over a period of time, such information should be made known to law enforcement 
and the federal banking agencies .  FinCEN ’s guidelines have suggest ed that banks should 
report continuing suspi cious activity by filing a report at least every 90 calendar days.  
Subsequent guidance permits banks with SAR requirements to file SARs for continuing 
activity after a 90 day review with the f iling deadline being 120 calendar days after the date 
of the previously r elated SAR filing.  Banks may also file SARs on continuing activity earlier 
than the 120- day deadline if the bank believes the activity warrants earlier review by law 
enforcement.66 This practice notif ies law enforcement of the continuing nature of the activity 
in aggregate .  In addition, this practice remind s the bank that it should continue to review the 
suspicious activity to determine whether other actions may be appropriate, such as bank management determining that it is necessary to terminate a relationship with the customer or 
employee that is the subject of the filing.  
Banks should be aware that law enforcement may have an interest in ensuring that certain 
accounts remain open notwithstanding suspicious or potential criminal activity in connection with those accounts.  If a law enforcement agency requests that a bank maintain a particular 
account, the bank should ask for a written request.  The written request should indicate that the agency has requ ested that the bank maintain the account and the purpose and duration of 
the request .  Ultimately, the decision to maintain or close an account should be made by a 
bank in accordance with its own standards and guidelines.
67 
The bank should develop policies, procedures, and processes indicating when to escalate issues or problems identified as the result of repeat SAR filings on accounts.  The procedures 
should include: 
•Review by senior management and legal staff (e.g., BSA compliance officer or SAR
committee ).
•Criteria for when analysis of the overall customer relationship is necessary.
•Criteria for whe ther and, if so, when to close the account.
•Criteria for when to notify law enforcement, if app ropriate .
SAR Completion and Filing  
SAR completion and filing are a critical part of the SAR monitoring and reporting process.  
Appropriate policies, procedures, and processes should be in place to ensure SARs  are filed in a timely manner, are complete and accurate, and that the narrative provides a sufficient descr iption of the activity reported as well as the basis for filing .  FinCEN developed a new 
electronic BSA Suspicious Activity Report (BSAR) that replaced FinCEN SAR -DI form TD 
F 90-22.47.  The BSAR provides a uniform data collection format that can be used a cross 
multiple industries.  As of April 1, 2013, the BSAR is mandatory and must be filed through

statutory and regulatory expectations for banks. 
The BSAR includes a number of additional data elements pertaining to the type of suspicious 
activity and the financial services involved .  Certain fields in the BSA R are marked as 
“critical” for technical filing purposes .  This means the BSA E -Filing System does not accept 
filings in which these fields are left blank.  For these items, the bank must either provide the 
requested information or check the “unknown” box that is provided with each critical field.  
Banks should provide the most complete filing information available consistent with existing regulatory expectations, regardless of whether or not the individual fields are deemed critical for technical filing purposes.

B
anks should report the information that they know, or that otherwise arises, as part of their 
case reviews .  Other than the critical fields, the addition of the new and expanded data 
elements does not create an expectation that banks will revise internal programs, or develop new programs, to capture information t hat reflects the expanded lists .
69  Refer t o Appendix T 
for additional information on filing through the BSA E- Filing System.   
Timing of a SAR Filing  
The SAR rules require that a SAR be electronically filed through the BSA E- Filing System 
no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR .  If no s uspect can be identified , the time period for filing a 
SAR is extended to 60 days.  Organizations may need to review transaction or account activity for a customer to determine whether to file a SAR .  The need for a review of 
customer activity or transactions does not necessarily indicate a need to file a SAR .  The time 
period for filing a SAR starts when the organization, during its review or because of other factors, knows or has reason to suspect that the activity or transactions under review meet 
one or more of the definitions of suspicious activity.
70 
The phrase “initial detection” should not be interpreted as meaning the moment a transaction 
is highlighted for review .  There are a variety of legitimate transactions that could raise a red 
flag simply because they are inconsistent with an accountholder’s normal account activity.  For example, a real estate investment (purchase or sale), the receipt of an inheritance, or a gift, may cause an account to have a significant credit or debit that would be inconsistent 
with typical account activity .  The bank’s automated account monitoring system or initial 
discovery of information, such as system- generated reports, may flag the transaction; 
however, this should not be considered initial detection of potential suspicious activity.  The 30-day (or 60-day) period does not begin until an appropriate review is conducted and a

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  71 2/27/2015.V2  determination is made that the transaction under review is “suspicious” within the meaning 
of the SAR regulation.71 
Whenever possible, an expeditious review of the transaction or the account is recommended 
and can be of significant assistance to law enforcement .  In any event, the review should be 
completed in a reasonable period of time.  What constitutes a “reasonable period of time” varies  according to the facts and circumstances of the particular matter being reviewed and 
the effectiveness of the SAR monitoring, reporting, and decision- making process of each 
bank.  The  key factor is that a bank has established adequate procedures for reviewing and 
assessing facts and circumstances identified as potentially suspicious, and that those 
procedures are documented and followed.
72 
For situations requiring immediate attention, in addition to filing a timely SAR , a bank must 
immediately notify, by telephone, an “ appropriate law enforcement authority ” and, as 
necessary , the bank’s primary regulator.  For this initial notification, an  “appropriate law 
enforcement authority” would generally be the local office of the IRS Criminal Investigation 
Division or the FBI.  Notifying law enforcement of a suspicious activity does not relieve a bank of its obligation to file a SAR.
73 
SAR Quality  
Banks are required to file SARs that are complete, thorough, and timely .  Banks should 
include all known subject information on the SAR.  T he importance of the accuracy of this 
information cannot be overstated.  Inaccurate information on the SAR, or an incomplete or 
disorganized narrative, may make further analysis difficult, if not impossible .  However, 
there may be legitimate reasons why certain information may not be provided in a SAR, such as when the filer does not have the information.  A thorough and complete narrative may make the difference in determining whether the described conduct and its possible criminal 
nature are clearly understood by law enforcement .  Because the SAR narrative section is the 
only area summarizing suspicious activity, the section, as stated on the SAR, is “critical. ” 
Thus, a failure to adequately describe the factors making a transaction or activity suspicious 
undermines the purpose of the SAR. 
To inform and assist banks in reporting instances of suspected money laundering, terrorist 
financing, and fraud, FinCEN issu es advisories and guidance containing examples of “red 
flags.”  In order to assist law enforcement in its efforts to target these activities,  FinCEN 
requests that banks check the appropriate box (es) in the Suspicious Activity Information

73 For suspicious activity related to terrorist activity, institutions may also call FinCEN’s Financial Institution’s 
terrorist hot line’s toll-free number (866) 556-3974 ( seven  days a week, 24 hours a day) to further facilitate the 
immediate transmittal of relevant information to the appropriate authorities.

guidance can be found on FinCEN W eb site.74 
By their nature, SAR narratives are subjective, and examiners generally should not criticize 
the bank’s interpretation of the facts .  Nevertheless, banks should ensure that SAR narratives 
are complete, thoroughly describe the extent and nature of the suspicious activity, and are included within the SAR.  The BS AR accept s a single, Microsoft Excel -compatible comma 
separated value (csv) file no larger than one (1) megabyte as an attachment as part of the report.  This capability allows a bank to include transactional data such as specific financial transactions and funds transfers or other analytics  that are more readable or usable in this 
format than it would be if otherwise included in the narrative.  Such an attachment is  be 
considered a part of the narrative and is not considered to be a substitute for the narrative.  For example, narratives should not simply state “see attachment” if the bank included a csv 
attachment .  As with other information that may be prepared in connection with the filing of 
a SAR, an attachment is considered supporting documentation and should be treated as 
confidential to the extent that it indicates the  existence of a SAR .  
More specific guidance is available in Appendix L (“SAR Quality Guidance”)  to assist 
banks in writing, and assist examiners in evaluating, SAR narratives.
75 
Notifying Board of Directors of SAR Filings  
Banks are required by the SAR re gulations of their federal banking agency to notify the 
board of directors or an appropriate board committee that SARs have been filed.  However, the regulations do not mandate a particular notification format and banks should have flexibility in structuring their format .  Therefore, banks may, but are not required to, provide 
actual copies of SARs to the board of directors or a board committee.  Alternatively, banks may opt to provide summaries, tables of SARs filed for specific violation types, or other forms of notification .  Regardless of the notification format used by the bank, management 
should provide sufficient information on its SAR filings to the board of directors or an appropriate committee in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties, while being mindful of the 
confidential nature of the SAR.
76 
74 For more information, refer to SAR Advisory Key Terms  on the FinCEN Web site. 
75 Guidance to assist banks in filing SARs can be found in the FinCEN Suspicious Activity Report (FinCEN 
SAR) Electronic Filing Requirements  Release Date October 2012, Version 1.2 .  Other guidance ava ilable from 
FinCEN includes “ Suggestions for Addressing Common Errors Noted in Suspicious Activity Reportin g” 
(October 10, 2007) . 
76 As noted in the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group’s The SAR Activity Review — Trends, Tips & Issues , Issue 
2, June 2001, “In the rare instance when suspicious activity is related to an individual in the organization, such 
as the president or one of the members of the board  of directors, the established policy that would require 
notification of a SAR filing to such an individual should not be followed.  Deviations to established policies and 
procedures so as to avoid notification of a SAR filing to a subject of the SAR should be documented and 
appropriate uninvolved senior organizational personnel should be so advised.”

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  73 2/27/2015.V2  Record Retention and Supporting Documentation 
Banks must retain copies of SARs and supporting documentation for five years from the date 
of filing the SAR.  The bank can retain copies in paper or electronic format.  Additionally, 
banks must provide all documentation supporting the filing of a SAR upon request by FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or federal banking agency.  “Supporting documentation” refers to all documents or records that assisted a bank in making the determination that certain activity required a SAR filing.  No legal process is required for disclosure of supporting documentation to FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or 
federal banking agency.
77 
Prohibition of SAR Disclosure  
No bank, and no director, officer, employee, or agent of a bank that reports a suspicious 
transaction may notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been 
reported .  A SAR and any information that would reveal the existence of a SAR , are 
confidential , except as is necessary to fulfill BSA  obligations and responsibilities.  For 
example, the existence or even the non -existence of a SAR must be kept confidential, as well 
as the information contained in the SAR to the extent that the information would reveal the existence of a SAR .
 78  Furthermore, FinCEN and the federal banking agencies take the 
position that a bank’s internal controls for the filing of SARs should minimize the risks of 
disclosure. 
A bank or its agent may reveal the exist ence of a SAR to fulfill responsibilities consistent 
with the BSA , provided no person involved in a suspicious transaction is notified that the 
transaction has been reported .  The  underlying facts, transactions, and supporting documents 
of a SAR may be dis closed to another financial institution for the preparation of a joint SAR, 
or in connection with certain employment references or termination notices to the full extent 
authorized in 31 USC 5318(g)(2)(B).  The sharing of a SAR by a bank or its agent with certain permissible entities within the bank’s corporate organizational structure for purposes 
consistent with Title II of the Bank Secrecy Act is also allowed . 
Any person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR or the information 
contained in a SAR, except when such disclosure is requested by FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement
79 or federal banking agency, shall decline to produce the SAR or to provi de 
77 Refer to Suspicious Activity Report Supporting Documentation , June 13, 2007.  
78 FinCEN and the OCC issued final rules amending the confidentiality provisions of suspicious activity reports. 
The rules clarify how, when, and to whom SAR information, and the existence of a SAR may be disclosed. 
Refer to 75 Fed. Reg.  75576 (December 3, 2010) (OCC) and 75 Fed. Reg.  R 75593 (December 3, 2010) 
(FinCEN). 
79 Examples of agencies to which a SAR or the information contained therein could be provided include: the 
criminal investigative services of the armed forces; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; an attorney general, district attorney, or state’s attorney at the state or local level; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal Revenue Service or tax enforcement agencies at the state level; the Office of Foreign Assets Control; a state or local police depart ment; a United States Attorney’s Office; 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; and the U.S. Secret Service.  For additional information, refer to Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group, “Section 5 —Issues and Guidance,” The SAR

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  74 2/27/2015.V2  any information that would disclose that a SAR has been prepared or filed, citing 31 CFR 
1020.320(e) and 31 USC 5318(g)(2)(A)(i).  FinCEN and the bank’s federal banking agency 
should be notified of any such request and of the bank’s response. 
Examiners should follow their respective agency’s protocol on discovery of the improper 
disclosure of a SAR.  Examiners also should ensure the bank has notified the appropriate 
federal banking agency and FinCEN of the improper disclosure. 
Sharing SARs With Head  Offices, Controlling Companies , and 
Certain U.S. Affiliates  
Previously issued guidance clarified that sharing of a SAR or, more broadly, any information 
that would reveal the existence of a SAR, with a head office or controlling company (including overseas) pr omotes compliance with the applicable requirements of the BSA by 
enabling the head office or controlling company to discharge its oversight responsibilities with respect to enterprise -wide risk management, including oversight of a bank’s compliance 
with ap plicable laws and regulations.
 80 
A controlling company as defined in the guidance includes: 
•A bank holding company (BHC), as defined in section 2 of the BHC Act.
•A savings and loan holding company, as defined in section 10(a) of the Home Owners ’
Loan Act.
•A company having the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management policies of
an industrial loan company or a parent company or to vote 25 percent or more of any
class of voting shares of an industrial loan company or parent company.
The guidanc e confirms that:  
•A U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank may share a SAR with its head office outside
the United States.
•A U.S. bank may share a SAR with controlling companies whether domestic or foreign.
In addition, a bank that has filed a SAR may share the SAR, or any information that would 
reveal the existence of the SAR, with an affiliate provided the affiliate is subject to a SAR regulation.
81  An affiliate is defined as  any company under common control with, or 
controlled by, that depository institu tion.  Under “common control’’ means that another 
company : 
•Directly or indirectly or acting through one or more other persons owns, controls, or has
the power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of the voting securities of the company
and the depositor y institution; or

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  75 2/27/2015.V2  •Controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of the
company an d the depository institution.
Controlled by means that the depository institution:  
•Directly or indirectly has the power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of the voting
securities of the company; or
•Controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors or trus tees of the
company. See 12 USC 1841(a)(2).
Because foreign branches of U.S. banks are regarded as foreign banks for  the purposes of the 
BSA, they are affiliates that are not subject to a SAR regulation.  Accordingly, a U.S. bank that has filed a SAR may not share the SAR, or any information that would reveal the 
existence of the SAR, with its foreign branches.  
Banks should maintain appropriate arrangements with head offices, controlling companies, 
and affiliates to protect the confidentiality of SARs.  The bank should have policies and 
procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of the SAR as part of their internal controls.

Suspicious Activity Reporting — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  76 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Suspicious Activity Reporting  
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes, and overall compliance 
with statutory and regulatory requirements for monitoring, detecting, and reporting 
suspicious activities.  
Initially, examiners may elect to “map out” the process the bank follows to monitor for, 
identify, research, and report suspicious activities.  Once the examiner has an understanding 
of the process, the examiner should follow an alert through the entire process. 
Identification of Unusual Activity 
1.R eview the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes for identifying, researching, and
reporting suspicious activity.  Determine whether they in clude the following:
•Lines of communication for the referral of unusual activity to appropriate personnel.
•Designation of individual(s) responsible for identifying, researching, and reportingsuspicious activities.
•Monitoring systems used to identify unusual activity.
•Procedures for reviewing and evaluating the transaction activity of subjects included
in law enforcement requests (e.g., grand jury subpoenas, section 314(a) requests, or
National Security Letters (NSL )) for suspicious activity.  NSLs are high ly
confidential documents ; as such, examiners do not review or sample specific NSLs .
Instead, examiners should evaluate the policies, procedures, and processes for:
− Responding to NSLs.
− Evaluating the account of the target for suspicious activity.
− Filing SARs , if necessary.
− Handling account closures.
2.Review the bank ’s monitoring systems and how the system(s) fits into the bank’ s
overall suspicious activity monitoring and reporting process.  Complete the appropriate
examination procedures that follow.  When  evaluating the effectiveness of the bank’ s
monitoring systems, examiners should consider the bank’ s overall risk profile ( higher -
risk products, services, customers, entities, and geographic locations), volume of
transactions, and adequacy of staffing.
Transaction ( Manual Transaction ) Monitoring 
3.R eview the bank ’s transaction monitoring reports .  Determine whether the reports capture
all areas that pose money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  Examples of thesereports include: currency activity r eports, funds transfer reports, monetary instrument
sales reports, ATM transaction reports, large item reports, significant balance change
reports, nonsufficient funds (NSF) reports, and nonresident alien (NRA) reports.
--- Page 82 ---
Suspicious Activity Reporting — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  77 2/27/2015.V2  4.D etermine whether the bank ’s transaction monitoring systems use reasonable filtering
criteria whose programming has been independently verified .  Determine whether the
monitoring systems generate accurate reports at a reasonable frequency.
Surveillance ( Automated Account ) Monitoring 
5.Ide ntify the types of customers, products, and services that are included within the
surveillance monitoring system.
6.Identify the system’s methodology for establishing and applying expected activity or
profile filtering criteria and for generating monitor ing reports.  Determine whether the
system ’s filtering criteria are reasonable.
7. Determine whether the programming of the methodology has been independently
validated.
8.Determine that controls ensure limited access to the monitoring system and sufficie nt
oversight of assumption changes.
Managing Alerts 
9.D etermine whether the bank has policies, procedures, and processes to ensure the timely
generation of, review of, and response to reports used to identify unusual activities.
10.Determine whether policies, procedures, and processes require appropriate research when
monitoring reports identify unusual activity.
11.Evaluate the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes for referring unusual activity
from all business lines to the personnel or department responsible for evaluating unusual
activity .  The process should ensure that all applicable information (e.g., criminal
subpoenas, NSLs, and section 314(a) requests) is effectively evaluated.
12.Verify that staffing levels are sufficient to review repor ts and alerts and investigate items,
and that staff possess the requisite experience level and proper investigatory tools.  Thevolume of system alerts and investigations should not be tailored solely to meet existing
staffing levels.
13.Determine whether  the bank ’s SAR decision process appropriately considers all available
CDD and EDD information.
SAR Decision Making 
14. Determine whether the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes include procedures for:
•D
ocumenting decisions not to file a SAR.
•Escal ating issues identified as the result of repeat SAR filings on accounts.
•Considering closing accounts as a result of continuous suspicious activity.
--- Page 83 ---
Suspicious Activity Reporting — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  78 2/27/2015.V2  SAR Completion and Filing  
15. Determine whether the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes provide for:
•Completing, filing, and retaining SARs and their supporting documentation.
•Reporting SARs to the board of directors, or a committee thereof, and informing
senior management.
•Sharing SARs with head offices and controlling companies , as necessary .
Transaction Testing  
Transaction testing of suspicious activity monitoring systems and reporting processes is intended to determine whether the bank’ s policies, procedures, and processes are adequate 
and effectively implemented .  Examiners should document t he factors they used to select 
samples and should maintain a list of the accounts sampled.  The size and the sample should 
be based on the following: 
•Weaknesses in the account monitoring systems.
•The bank’s overall BSA/AML risk profile (e.g., number and type of higher -risk products,
services, customers,  entities,  and geographi es).
•Quality and extent of review by audit or independent parties.
•Prior examination findings.
•Recent mergers, acquisitions, or other significant organizational changes.
•Conclusions or questions from the review of the bank’ s SARs.
Refer to Appendix O (“Examiner Tools for Transaction Testing”) for additional guidance. 
16. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
audit findings, sample specific customer accounts to review the following:•Suspicious activity monitoring reports.
•CTR download information.
•Higher -risk banking operations (products, services, customers, entities, and
geographi es).
•Customer activity.
•Subpoenas received by the bank.
•Decisions not to file a SAR.
17. For the customers selected previously, obtain the following information, if applicable:
•CIP and account-opening documentation.
•CDD documentation.
--- Page 84 ---
Suspicious Activity Reporting — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  79 2/27/2015.V2  •Two to three months of account statements covering the total customer relationship
and showing all transactions.
•Sample items posted against the account (e.g., copies of checks deposited and written,
debit or credit tickets, and funds transfer beneficiaries and originators).
•Other relevant information, such as loan files and correspondence.
18.Review the selected accounts for unusual activity .  If the examiner identifies unusual
activity, review customer information for indications that the activity is typical for the
customer (i.e., the sort of activity in which the customer is normally expected to engage) .
When reviewing for unusual activity, consider the following:
•For individual customers, whether the activity is consistent with CDD information
(e.g., occupation, expected account activity, and sources of funds and wealth).
•For business customers, whether the activity is consistent with CDD information(e.g., type of business, size, location, and target market).
19.Determine whether the transaction  or surveillance suspicious activity monitoring system
detected the activity  that the examiner identified as unusual.
20. For transactions identified as unusual, discuss the transactions with management.
Determine whether the account officer demonstrates knowledge of the customer and theunusual transactions.  After examining the  available facts, determine whether
management knows of a reasonable explanation for the transactions.
21.Determine whether the bank has failed to identify any reportable suspicious activity.
22.From the results of the sample, determine whether the transaction  or surveillance
suspicious activity monitoring system effectively detects unusual or suspicious activity.Identify the underlying cause of any deficiencies in the monitoring systems (e.g.,
inappropriate filters, insufficient risk assessment, or ina dequate decision  making).
23. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
audit findings, select a sample of management’ s research decisions to determine the
following:
•Whether management decisions to file or not file a SAR are supported and
reasonable.
•Whether documentation is adequate.
•Whether the decision process is completed and SARs are filed in a timely manner.
24. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’s
audit findings, sample the SARs downloaded from the BSA -reporting database or the
bank’s internal SAR records.  Review the quality of SAR content to assess the following:
•SARs contain accurate information.
--- Page 85 ---
Suspicious Activity Reporting — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  80 2/27/2015.V2  •SAR narratives are complete and thorough, and clearly explain why the activity is
suspicious (i.e., the SAR narrative should not simply state “see attachment” if the
bank included a csv file).
25. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the ability of policies, procedures, and processes to meet regulatoryrequirements associated with monitoring, detecting, and reporting suspicious activity.

Currency Transaction Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  81 2/27/2015.V2  Currency Transaction Reporting — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the 
reporting of large currency transactions. 
A bank must electronically file a Currency Transaction Report (CTR ) for each transaction in 
currency82 (deposit, withdrawal, exchange, or other payment or transfer) of more than 
$10,000 by, through, or to the bank.  Certain types of currency transactions need not be 
reported, such as those involving “exempt persons,” a group which can include retail or commercial customers meeting specific criteria for exemption .  Refer to the core overview 
section , “Currency Transaction Reporting Exemptions,” page  86, for further guidance . 
Aggregation of Currency Transactions  
Multiple currency transactions totaling more than $10,000 during any one business day are 
treated as a single transaction if the bank has knowledge that they are by or on behalf of the same person .  Transactions throughout the bank should be aggregated when determining 
multiple transactions .
83 
In cases where multiple businesses share a common owner, the presumption is that separately incorporated entities are independent persons.  The currency transactions of separately incorporated businesses should not automatically be aggregat ed as being on behalf o f any 
one person simply because those busines ses are owned by the same person.  Financial 
institutions should determine, based on information obtained in the ordinary course of business, whether multiple businesses that share a common owner are being opera ted 
independently depending on all the facts and circumstances.
84   
However, if a financial institution determines that these businesses (or one or more of the businesses and the private accounts of the owner) are not operating separately or independently of one another or their common owner ( e.g., the businesses are staffed by the 
same employees and are located at the same address, the bank accounts of one business are repeatedly used to pay the expenses of another business, or the business bank accounts ar e 
repeatedly used to pay the personal ex penses of the owner) the financial institution may 
determine that aggregating the businesses’ transactions is appropriate because the transactions were made on behalf of a single person.  
If
 a financial institution determines that the businesses are independent, then it should not 
aggregate the separate transactions of these businesses .  Alternatively, once a financial 
institution determines that the businesses are not independent of each other or their common 
owner, then the transactions of these businesses should be aggregated going forward. 
82 Currency is defined as coin and paper money of the United States or any other country as long as it is 
customarily accepted as money in the country of issue.  
83 Refer to the FinCEN Web site . 
84 Refer to FinCEN’s guidance, Currency T ransaction Report Aggregation for Businesses with Common 
Ownership , (FIN -2012- G001) (March 16, 2012) . 
--- Page 87 ---
Currency Transaction Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  82 2/27/2015.V2  Types of currency transactions subject to reporting requirements individually or by 
aggregation include, but are not limited to, denomination exchanges, individual retirement accounts (IRA), loan payments, automated teller machine (ATM) transactions, purchases of certificates of deposit, deposits and withdrawals, funds transfers paid for in currency, 
monetary instrument purchases, and certain transactions involving armored car services .
85   
Banks are strongly encouraged to develop systems necessary to aggregate currency 
transactions throughout the bank.  Management should ensure that an adequate system is 
implemented that appropriately reports currency transactions subject to the BSA requirement. 
Filing and Record Retention  
FinCEN developed a new electronic Bank Secrecy Act Currency Transaction Report (BCTR) 
that replaced FinCEN CTR Form 104.  The BCTR provides a uniform data collection format 
that can be used across multiple indus tries.  As of April 1, 2013, the BCTR is mandatory and 
must be filed through FinCEN’s BSA E-Filing System.  The BCTR does not create or 
otherwise change existing statutory and regulatory expectations for banks.   
Th
e BCTR includes a number of additional data elements pertaining to the financial services 
involved.  Certain fields in the BCTR are marked as “critical” for technical filing purposes; 
this means the BSA E -Filing System does not accept filings in which these fields are left 
blank.  For these items, the bank must either provide the requested information or check the “unknown” box that is provided with each c ritical field.  Banks should provide the most 
complete filing information available consistent with existing regulatory expectations, regardle ss of whether or not the individual fields are deemed critical for technical filing 
purposes.
86   
O
ther than the critical fields, the addition of the new and expanded data elements does not 
create an expectation that banks will revise internal programs, or  develop new programs, to 
capture information that reflects the expanded lists.   
A
 completed BCTR must be electronically filed with FinCEN within 15 calendar days after 
the date of the transaction . The bank must retain copies of CTRs for five years from the date 
of the report (31 CFR 1010.306(a)(2)).  The bank can retain hard copies or copies in 
electronic format . 
R
efer to Appendix T (“BSA E -Filing System”) for additional information. 
85For additional information on CTR filing requirements for transactions conducted through armored car 
services, refer to FIN- 2013- R001, Treatment of Armored Car Service Transactions Conducted on Behalf of

Currency Transaction Reporting — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  84 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Currency Transaction Reporting 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the 
reporting of large currency transactions. 
1.Determine whether the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes adequately address the
preparation, filing, and retention of CTRs .
2. Review correspondence that the bank has electronically received from FinCEN’s BSA E -
Filing System (refer to Appendix T for additional information on filing through the BSA
E-Filing System).   Determine whether management has taken corrective action, when
necessary.
3. Review the currency transaction system (e.g., how the bank identifies transactions
applicable for the filin g of a CTR) .  Determine whether the bank aggregates all or some
currency transactions within the bank.  Determine whether the bank aggregates
transactions by taxpayer identification number (TIN), individual taxpayer identificationnumber (ITIN), employer identification number (EIN), or customer information file (CIF)
number.  Also, evaluate how CTRs are filed on customers with missing TINs or EINs.
Transaction Testing  
4. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
a
udit findings, select a sample of filed CTRs (hard copy or electronic format) to
determine whether:
•CTRs are completed in accordance with FinCEN instructions.
•CTRs are filed for large currency transactions identified by tellers ’ cash proof sheets,
autom ated large currency transaction systems, or other types of aggregation systems
that cover all relevant areas of the bank, unless an exemption exists for the customer.
•CTRs are filed accurately and completely within 15 calendar days after the date of the
transaction.
•The bank’s independent testing confirms the integrity and accuracy of the MIS used
for aggregating currency transactions.  If not, the examiner should confirm the
integrity and accuracy of the MIS .
•The examiner ’s review should assess whether tellers have the capability to override
currency aggregation systems.   If so, the examiner should review controls in place to
ensure the override capability is used appropriately.  Controls may include
supervisory approval, generation of exception reports, and BSA officer and internal
audit review of exception reports.
•Discrepancies exist between the bank ’s records of CTRs and the CTRs reflected in
the BSA -reporting database.
--- Page 90 ---
Currency Transaction Reporting — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  85 2/27/2015.V2  •The bank retains copies (hard copy or electronic format) of CTRs for five years fro m
the date of the report ( 31 CFR 1010.306(a)(2)).
5. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the ability of policies, procedures, and processes to meet regulatory
requirements associated with  currency transaction reporting.

Currency Transaction Reporting Exemptions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  86 2/27/2015.V2  Currency Transaction Reporting Exemptions — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for 
exemptions from the currency transaction reporting requirements.  
U.S. Treasury regulations have historically recognized that the routine reporting of some 
types of large currency transactions does not necessarily aid law enforcement authorities and may place unreason able burdens on banks.  Consequently, a bank may exempt certain types 
of customers from currency tra nsaction reporting.  
T
he Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 (MLSA) established a two- phase 
exemption process.  Under Phase I exemptions, transactions in currency by banks, governmental departments or agencies, and listed  public companies and their subsidiaries are 
exempt from reporting.  Under Phase II exemptions, transactions in currency by smaller 
businesses that meet specific criteria laid out in Fin CEN ’s regulations may be exempted from 
reporting.  
Phase I CTR Exemptions (31 C FR 1020.315(b)(1) -(5)) 
FinCEN ’s rule identifies five categories of Phase I exempt persons:  
•A bank, to the extent of its domestic operations.
•A federal, state, or local government agency or department.
•Any entity exercising governmental authority within the United States.
•Any entity (other than a bank) whose common stock or analogous equity interests are
listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American  Stock Exchange or have been
designated as a NASDAQ National Market Security listed on the NASDAQ Stock
Market  (with some exceptions).
•Any subsidiary (other than a bank) of any “ listed entity ” that is organized under U.S. law
and at least 51 percent of whose common stock or analogous equity interest is owned by
the listed entity.
Filing Time Frames 
Banks must file a one-time Designation of Exempt Person report  (DOEP ) to exempt each 
eligible listed public company or eligible subsidiary  from currency transact ion reporting.  
The report must be filed electronically through the BSA E -Filing System within 30 days after 
the first transaction in currency that the bank wishes to exempt.  
Banks do not need to file a D OEP for Phase I -eligible customers that are banks, f ederal, state, 
or local governments, or entities exercising governmental authority.  Nevertheless, a bank 
should take the same steps to assure itself of a customer’s initial eligibility for exemption , 
and document the basis for the conclusion, that a reasonable and prudent bank would take to protect itself from loan or other fraud or loss based on misidentification of a person’s status.  Exemption  of a Phase I entity covers all transactions in currency with the exempted entity, 
not only transactions in currency conducted through an account.

Currency Transaction Reporting Exemptions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  87 2/27/2015.V2  Annual Review  
The information supporting each designation of a Phase I- exempt listed public company or 
subsidiary must be reviewed and verified by the bank at least once per year.  Annual reports, 
stock quotes from newspapers, or other information, such as electronic media could be used to document the review.  Banks do not need to confirm the continued exemption eligibility of Phase I customers that are banks, government agencies, or entities exercising governmental 
authority.  
Phase II CTR Exemptions (31 CFR 1020.315(b)(6) -(7)) 
A business that does not fall into any of the Phase I categories may still be exempted under 
the Phase II exemptions if it qualifies as either a “non-listed business” or as a “payroll 
customer. ” 
Non-Listed Businesses 
A “non-listed business” is defined as a commercial enterprise to the extent of its domestic 
operations and only with respect to transactions conducted through its exemptible accounts and that: (i) has maintained a transaction account at the exempting bank for at least two 
months or prior to the passing of two months’ time if the bank undertakes a risk- based 
analysis of that customer that allows it to form and document a reasonable belief that the customer has a legitimate business purpose for conducting frequent large currency transactions;  (ii) frequently
88 engages in transactions in currency with the bank in excess of 
$10,000; and (iii) is incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States or a state, 
or is registered as and eligible to do business within the United States or a state.  
Ineligible Businesses  
Certain businesses are ineligible for treatment as an exempt non-listed business (31 CFR 
1020.315(e)(8)).  An ineligible business is defined as a business engaged primarily in one or more of the following specified activities: 
•Serving as a financial institution or as agents for a financial institution of any type.
•Purchasing or selling motor vehicles of any kind, vessels, aircraft, farm equipment, or
mobile homes.
89
•P
racticing law, accounting, or medicine.
•Auctioning of goods.
•Chartering or operation of ships, buses, or aircraft.
88 FinCEN has noted that, for purposes of 31 CFR 1020.315(b)(6)(ii): “[Banks] may designate an otherwise 
eligible customer for Phase II exemption after the customer has within a year conducted five or more reportable 
cash transactions.” Refer to 73 Fed. Reg.  74010, 74014 (December 5, 2008).

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  88 2/27/2015.V2  •Operating a pawn brokerage.
•Engaging i n gaming of any kind (other than licensed pari- mutuel betting at race tracks).
•Engaging in investment advisory services or investment banking services.
•Operating a real estate brokerage.
•Operating in title insurance activities and real estate closings.
•Engaging in trade union activities.
•Engaging in any other activity that may, from time to time, be specified by FinCEN , such
as marijuana- related businesses .90
A
 business that engages in multiple business activities may qualify for an exemption as a 
non-listed  business as long as no more than 50 percent of its gross revenues per year91 are 
derived from one or more of the ineligible business activities listed in the rule.  
A bank must consider and maintain materials and other supporting information that allow it 
to substantiate that the decision to exempt the customer from currency transaction reporting was based upon a reasonable determination  that the customer derives no more than 50 
percent of its annual gross revenues from ineligible business activities.  Such a reasonable determination should be based upon its understanding of the nature of the customer’s business, the purpose of the customer’s accounts, and the actual or anticipated activity in 
those accounts.
92  
Payroll Customers  
A “payroll customer” is define d solely with respect to withdrawals for payroll purposes from 
existing exemptible accounts and as a person who: (i) has maintained a transaction account at 
the bank for at least two months or prior to the passing of two months’ time if the bank 
undertakes a risk -based analysis of that customer that allows it to form and document a 
reasonable belief that the customer has a legitimate business purpose for conducting frequent large currency transactions ; (ii) operates a firm that frequently

90 See FinCEN’s Guidance: BSA Expectations Regarding Marijuana- Related Businesses , FIN-2014- 001, 
February 14, 2014.  
91 Questions often arise in determining the “gross revenue” of gaming activities, such as lottery sales.  FinCEN 
has ruled that for the purpose of determining if a business derives more than 50 percent of it s gross revenue 
from gaming, the term gross revenue is intended to encompass the amount of money that a business actually 
earns from a particular activity, rather than the sales volume of such activity conducted by the business.  For example, if a business  engages in lottery sales, the “gross revenue” from this activity would be the amount of 
money that the business actually earns from lottery sales, rather than the amount of money that the business takes in on behalf of the state lottery system.  Refer to FinCEN Ruling 2002- 1, at the FinCEN Web site
.

Business Customer's Annual Gross Revenues that is Derived from Activities Ineligible for Exemption from 
Currency Transaction Reporting Requirement s, FIN -2009- G001, April 27, 2009.  
93 FinCEN issued a final rule substituting the term “frequently” for “regularly” in the provision of the 
exemption rules dealing with payroll customers 77 Fed. Reg. 33639, (June 7, 2012) and issued guidance

under the laws of the United States or a state, or is registered as and is eligible to do business 
within the United States or a state.  
Filing Time Frames 
After a bank has decided to exempt a Phase II customer, the bank must file a Designation of 
Exempt Person report  through the BSA E- Filing System within 30 days after the first 
transaction in currency that the bank plans to exempt.  
Annual Review  
The information supporting each designation of a Phase II exempt person must be reviewed 
and verified by the bank at least annually.  The bank should document the annual review.  
Moreover, consistent with this annual review, a bank must review and verify a t least annually 
that management monitors these Phase II accounts for suspicious transactions. 
Safe Harbor for Failure to File CTRs 
The rules ( 31 CFR 1020.315(e)(10 )(g); provide a safe harbor that a bank is not liable for the 
failure to file a CTR for a tr ansaction in currency by an exempt person, unless the bank 
knowingly provides false or incomplete information or has reason to believe that the customer does not qualify as an exempt customer .  In the absence of any specific knowledge 
or information indicating that a customer no longer meets the requirements of an exempt person, the bank is entitled to a safe harbor from civil penalties to the extent it continues to 
treat that customer as an exempt customer until the date of the customer ’s annual review. 
Effect on Other Regulatory Requirements 
The exemption procedures do not have any effect on the requirement that banks file SARs or 
on other recordkeeping requirements.  For example, the fact that a customer is an exempt person has no effect on a bank’s obligation to retain records of funds transfers by that person, 
or to retain records in connection with the sale of monetary instruments to that person. 
If a bank has improperly exempted accounts or ceases to treat a customer as exempt , it may  
revoke the exemption  by filing a Designation of Exempt Persons (DOEP) report and 
checking the “Exemption Revoked” box or revoke the exemption by filing CTRs on the 
customer .  In the case of improperly exempted accounts , the bank should begin filing CTRs 
and should contact FinCEN’s Regulatory Helpline
94 to request a determination on whether 
the backfiling of unreported currency  transactions is necessary.  
Additional information can be found on the FinCEN Web  site.

Currency Transaction Reporting Exemptions — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  90 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Currency Transaction Reporting Exemptions  
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for 
exemptions from the currency transaction reporting requirements.  
1. Determine whether the bank uses the Currency Transaction Report (CTR) exemption
process .  If yes, determine whether the policies, procedures, and processes for CTR
exemptions are adequate.
Phase I Exemptions ( 31 CFR 1020.315(b)(1) -(5) 
2.D etermine whether the bank files the Designation of Exempt Person report electronically
through FinCEN’s E- Filing System to exempt eligible listed public companies and their
subsidiaries from CTR reporting as defined in 31 CFR 1020.311.  The report should be
filed within 30 days of the first reportable transaction that was exempted.
3. Assess whether ongoing and reasonable due diligence is performed, including required
annual reviews to determine whether a listed public company or subsidiary remains
eligible for designation as an exempt person under the regulatory requirements.
Management should properly document exemption determinations (e.g., with stock
quotes from newspapers and consolidated returns for the entity).
Phase II Exemptions ( 31 CFR 1020.315(b )(6)-(7) 
Under the regulation, the definition of exempt persons includes “non-listed businesses” 
and “payroll customers” as defined in 31 CFR 1020.315(b)(6)- (7).  Nevertheless, several 
businesses remain ineligible for exemption purposes; refer to 31 CFR 1020.315(e)(8) and 
the “Currency Transaction Reporting Exemptions — Overview” section of this manual. 
4.Determine whether the bank files a Designation of Exempt Person report electronically
through the FinCEN E -Filing System to exempt a customer, as identif ied by
management, from CTR reporting.
5. Determine whether the bank maintains documentation to support that the “non- listed
businesses” it has designated as exempt from CTR reporting do not receive more than 50
percent of gross revenue from ineligible bus iness activities.
6. Assess whether ongoing and reasonable due diligence is performed, including required
annual reviews, to determine whether a customer is eligible for designation as exempt
from CTR reporting .  Customers must meet the following requirements to be eligible for
exemption under the regulation:
•Have frequent95 currency transactions in excess of $10,000 (including withdrawals to
pay domestic employees in currency in the case of a payroll customer).
95 FinCEN has noted that when interpreting the term “frequently” for purposes of 31 CFR 1020.315(b)(6)(ii): 
“[Banks] may designate an otherwise eligible customer for Phase II exemption after the customer has within a

registered as and eligible to do business within the United States or a state.
•Maintain a transaction account at the bank for at least two months (or prior to the
passing of two months’ time if the bank has conducted a risk- based analysis of a
customer that allows it to form and document a reasonable belief that the customerhas a legitimate business purpose for conducting frequent large currency
transactions).
Transaction Testing  
7. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
a
udit findings, select a sample of Designation of Exempt Person (DOEP) reports  from the
bank to test compliance with the regulatory requirements (e.g., only eligible businessesare exempted  and adequate supporting documentation is maintained).
8. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the ability of policies, procedures, and processes to meet regulatoryrequirements associated with currency transaction reporting exemptions.

Information Sharing — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  92 2/27/2015.V2  Information Sharing — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the financial institution ’s compliance with the statutory and regulatory 
requirements for the “Special Information Sharing Procedures to Deter Money Laundering 
and Terrorist Activity ” (section 314 Information Requests). 
On September 26, 2002, final regulations (31 CFR 103.100 and 31 CFR 103.110) 
implementing section 314 of the USA PATRIOT  Act became effective.  The regulations 
established procedures for information sharing to deter money laundering and terrorist activity .  On February 5, 2010, FinCEN amended the regulations to allow state, local, and 
certain foreign law enforcement agencies  access to the information sharing program.
96 
Information Sharing Between Law Enforcement and Financial Institutions 
— Section 314( a) of the USA PATRIOT  Act (31 CFR 1010.520 ) 
A federal , state, local, or foreign97 law enforcement agency investigating terrorist activity or 
money laundering may request that FinCEN solicit, on its behalf, certain information from a 
financial institution or a group of financial institutions .  The law enforcement agency must 
provide a written certification to FinCEN attesting that th ere is credible evidence of 
engagement or reasonably suspected engagement in terrorist activity or money laundering for each individual, entity, or organization about which the law enforcement agency is seeking 
information .  The law enforcement agency also  must provide specific identifiers, such as a 
date of birth and address, which would permit a financial institution to differentiate among 
common or similar names .  Upon receiving a completed written certification from a law 
enforcement agency, FinCEN may require a financial institution to search its records to 
determine whether it maintains or has maintained accounts for, or has engaged in transactions 
with, any specified individual, entity, or organization. 
Search Requirements  
Upon receiving an information request,98 a financial institution must conduct a one- time 
search of its records to identify accounts or transactions of a named suspect.  Unless 
otherwise instructed by an information request, financial institutions must search their records for current accounts, accounts maintained during the preceding 12 months, and 
transactions conducted outside of an account by or on behalf of a named suspect during the preceding six months.  The financial institution must search its records and report any positive ma tches to FinCEN within 14 days, unless otherwise specified in the information 
request.  
In March 2005, FinCEN began posting section 314(a) subject lists through the W eb-based 
314(a) Secure Information Sharing System .  Every two weeks, or more frequently if an 
emergency request is transmitted, the financial institution’s designated point(s) of contact 
receives notification from FinCEN that there are new postings on the FinCEN ’s secure Web 
96 Refer to 75 Fed. Reg.  6560 (Febru ary 10, 2010).  
97 A foreign law enforcement agency must come from a jurisdiction that is a party to the Agreement on Mutual 
Legal Assistance between the United States and the European Union.  Id. at 6560- 61. 
98 If the request contains multiple suspects, it is often referred to as a “314(a) list.”

Information Sharing — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  93 2/27/2015.V2  site.  The point of contact is  able to access the current section 314(a) subject list (and one 
prior) and download the files in various formats for searching.  F inancial institutions should 
report all positive matches via the Secure Information Sharing System (SISS) .   
FinCEN has provided financial institutions with General Instructions and Frequently Asked 
Questions (FAQ) relating to the section 314(a) process.  Unless otherwise instructed by an information request, financial institutions must search the records specified in the Genera l 
Instructions.
99 The General Instructions or FAQs are made available to the financial 
institutions on the S ISS.100 
If a financial institution identifies any account or transaction, it must report to  FinCEN that it 
has a match .  No details should be provided to FinCEN other than the fact that the financial 
institution has a match .  A negative response is not required.  A financial institution may 
provide the 314(a) subject lists to a third -party service provider or vendor to perform or 
facilitate record search es as long as the institution takes the necessary steps, through the use 
of an agreement or procedures, to ensure that the third  party safeguards and maintains the 
confidentiality of the information.  
According to the FAQs available on the S ISS, if a financial institution receiving 314(a) 
subject lists through the SISS  fails to perform or complete searches on one or more 
information request received during the previous 12 months, it must immediately obtain these prior requests from FinCEN and perform a retroactive search of its records.
101 A 
financial institution is not required to perform retroactive searches in connection with information sharing requests that were transmitted more than 12 months before the date upon which it discovers that it failed to perfo rm or complete searches on prior information 
requests .  Additionally, in performing retroactive searches a financial institution is not 
required to search records created after the date of the original information request.  
Use Restrictions and Confidentiality  
Financial institutions should develop and implement comprehensive policies, procedures, and processes for responding to section 314(a) requests.  The regulation restricts the use of the information provided in a section 314(a) request (31 CFR 1010.520( b)(3)(iv )).  A financial 
institution may only use the information to report the required information to FinCEN, to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction, or to assist in BSA/AML compliance .  While the section 314(a) subject  list could be used to determine 
99 For example, regarding funds transfers, the “General Instructions” state that, unless the instructions to a 
specific 314(a) request state otherwise, banks are required to search funds transfer records maintained p ursuant 
to 31 CFR 1010.410, to determine whether the named subject was an originator/transmittor of a funds transfer 
for which the bank was the originator/transmittor’s financial institution, or a beneficiary/recipient of a funds 
transfer for which the bank was the beneficiary/recipient’s financial institution.  
100 The General Instructions and FAQs also can be obtained by calling  the FinCEN  Resource Center ’s toll -free 
number  (800) 767-2825 or (703) 905 -3591 or by e -mailing FRC@fincen.gov . 
101 The financial institution should contact FinCEN’s 314 Program Office by e-mailing sys314a@fincen.gov to  
obtain prior information requests.  If the financial institution discovers a positive match while performing a 
retroactive search, it should contact the 314 Program Office ’s toll-free number at (866) 326-8314.  Financial 
institutions must respond with positive matches within 14 days of receiving a prior information request; 
however, if a retroactive search results in no positive matches then no further action is required.

Information Sharing — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  94 2/27/2015.V2  whether to establish or maintain an account, FinCEN strongly discourages financial 
institutions from using this as the sole factor in reaching a decision to do so unless the request specifically states otherwi se.  Unlike the OFAC lists, section 314(a) subject lists are 
not permanent “ watch lists. ” In fact, section 314(a) subject  lists generally relate to one -time 
inquiries and are not updated or corrected if an investigation is dropped, a prosecution is declined, or a subject is exonerated.  Further, the names do not correspond to convicted or indicted persons; rather a 314(a) subject need only be “reasonably suspected” based on credible evidence of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering .  Moreover, FinC EN 
advises that inclusion on a section 314(a) subject list should not be the sole factor used to 
determine whether to file a SAR .  Financial institutions should establish a process for 
determining when and if a SAR should be filed.  Refer to the core overv iew section , 
“Suspicious Activity Reporting,” page  60, for additional guidance. 
Actions taken pursuant to information provided in a request from FinCEN do not affect a financial institution ’s obligations to comply with all of the rules and regulations of OFAC nor 
do they affect a financial institution ’s obligations to respond to any legal process.  
Additionally, actions taken in response to a request do not relieve a financial institution of its obligation to file a SAR and immediately notify law enforcemen t, if necessary, in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations. 
A financial institution cannot disclose to any person, other than to FinCEN, the institution’ s 
primary banking  regulator, or the law enforcement agency on whose behalf FinCEN is 
requestin g information, the fact that FinCEN has requested or obtained information.  A 
financial institution should designate one or more points of contact for receiving information 
requests .  FinCEN has stated that an affiliated group of financial institutions may  establish 
one point of contact to distribute the section 314(a) subject list to respond to requests.  
However, the section 314(a) subject  lists cannot be shared with any foreign office, branch, or 
affiliate (unless the request specifically states otherwise), and the lists cannot be shared with affiliates, or subsidiaries of bank holding companies, if the affiliates or subsidiaries are not 
financial institutions as described in 31 USC 5312(a)(2). 
Each financial institution must maintain adequate procedures to protect the security and 
confidentiality of requests from FinCEN .  The procedures to ensure confidentiality are 
considered adequate if the financial institution applies procedures similar to those it has established to comply with section 501 of the Gramm– Leach –Bliley Act (15 USC 6801) for 
the protection of its customers ’ nonpublic personal information.  Financial institutions may 
keep a log of all section 314(a) requests received and of any positive matches identified and 
reported to FinCEN. 
Documentation  
Additionally, documentation that all required searches were performed is essential.  Banks 
may print or store a search self -verification document from the Web -based 314(a) SISS for 
each 314(a ) subject list transmission .  Additionally, a Subject Response List can be printed 
for documentation purposes.  The Subject Response List displays the total number of positive responses submitted to FinCEN for that transmission, the transmission date, the submitted date, and the tracking number and subject name that had the positive hit.  If the financial 
institution elects to maintain copies of the section 314(a) requests, it should not be criticized 
--- Page 100 ---
Information Sharing — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  95 2/27/2015.V2  for doing so, as long as it appropriately secures them a nd protects their confidentiality .  
Audits should include an evaluation of compliance with these guidelines within their scope. 
FinCEN regularly updates a list of recent search transmissions, including information on the 
date of transmission, tracking number, and number of subjects listed in the transmission.102 
Bankers and examiners may review this list to verify that search requests have been received .  
Each bank should contact its primary federal regulator for guidance to ensure it obtains the 
section 314(a) subject list and for updating contact information.103 
Voluntary Information Sharing — Section 314( b) of the USA PATRIOT  
Act (31 CFR 1010.540 ) 
Section 314(b) encourages financial institutions104 and associations of financial institutions105 
located in the United States to share information in order to identify and report activities that 
may involve terrorist activity or money laundering .  Section 314(b) also provides specific 
protection from civil liability .106 To avail itself of this statutory safe harbor from liability,  a 
financial institution or an association must notify FinCEN of its intent to engage in information sharing and that it has established and w ill maintain adequate procedures to 
protect the security and confidentiality of the information.  Failure to comply with the requirements of 31 CFR 1010.540 result s in loss of safe harbor protection for information 
sharing and may result in a violation of privacy laws or other laws and regulations. 
If a financial institution chooses to voluntarily participate in section 314(b), policies, 
procedures, and processes should be developed and implemented for sharing and receiving of 
information. 
A notice to share information is effective for one year.
107 The financial institution should 
designate a point of contact for receiving and providing information.  A financial institution 
should establish a process for sending and receiving information sharing requests.  
102 This list, titled “Law Enforcement Information Sharing with the Financial Industry,” is available on the 
“Section 314(a)” page of FinCEN Web site.  The list contains information on each search request transmitted 
since January 4, 2005, and is updated after each transmission. 
103 Refer to the FinCEN Web site  for section 314(a) contacts for each primary regulator.  
104 31 CFR 1010.540 generally defines “financial institution” as any financial institution described in 31  USC 
5312(a)(2) that is required to establish and maintain an AML compliance program.  Refer to FinCEN’s Section 
314(b) Fact Sheet dated October 2013 for general information.  
105 In July 2012, FinCEN issued an administrative ruling that clarified the meaning of “association of financial 
institutions.”  See FIN-2012- R006 .  
106 FinCEN has indicated that a financial institution participating in the section 314(b) program may share 
information relating to transactions that the institution suspects may involve the proceeds of one or more 
specified unlawful activities (SUAs) and such an institution will still remain within the protection of the section 
314(b) safe harbor from liability.  Information related to the SUAs may be shared appropriately within the 
314(b) safe harbor to the extent t hat the financial institution suspects that the transaction may involve the 
proceeds of one or more SUAs and the purpose of the permitted information sharing under the 314(b) rule is to identify and report activities that the financial institution suspects  may involve possible  terrorist activity or 
money laundering.  Refer to 
Guidance on the Scope of Permissible Information Sharing Covered by Section 
314(b) Safe Harbor of the  USA PATRIOT Act , FIN-2009- G002, June 16, 2009.

Information Sharing — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  96 2/27/2015.V2  Additionally, a financial institution must take reasonable steps to verify that the other 
financial institution or association of financial institutions with which it intends to share 
information has also submitted the required notice to FinCEN.  FinCEN provi des 
participating financial institutions with access to a list of other participating financial 
institutions and their related contact information.  
If a financial institution receives such information from another financial institution, it must 
also limit use of the information and maintain its security and confidentiality ( 31 CFR 
1010.540(b)(4).  Such information may be used only to identify and, where appropriate, report on money laundering and terrorist activities; to determine whether to establish or maintain an account; to engage in a transaction; or to assist in BSA compliance.  The 
procedures to ensure confidentiality are considered adequate if the financial institution applies procedures similar to the ones it has established to comply with section 501 of the Gramm –Leach –Bliley Act (15 USC 6801) for the protection of its customers’ nonpublic 
personal information.  The safe harbor does not extend to sharing of information across international borders.  In addition, section 314(b) does not authorize a financial institution to share a SAR, nor does it permit the financial institution to disclose the existence or nonexistence of a SAR .  If a financial institution shares information under section 314(b) 
about the subject of a prepared or filed SAR, the information shared should be limited to underlying transaction and customer information.  A financial institution may use 
information obtained under section 314(b) to determine whether to file a SAR, but the intention to prepare or file a SAR cannot be shared with another financial institution .  
Financial institutions should establish a process for determining when and if a SAR should be 
filed.  
Actions taken pursuant to information obtained through the voluntary information sharing 
process do not affect a financial institution ’s obligations to respond to any legal process.  
Additionally, actions taken in response to information obtained through the voluntary information sharing process do not relieve a financial institution of its obligation to file a SAR a nd to immediately notify law enforcement, if necessary, in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations.

institution ’s point of contact.  If the financial institution is not receiving information
requests or contact information changes, the financial institution should update its contactinformation with its primary regulator in accordance with the instructions on the 
FinCEN
Web site .
2. Verify that the financial institution has sufficient policies, procedures, and processes to
doc
ument compliance; maintain sufficient internal controls; provide ongoing training;
and independently test its compliance with 31 CFR 1010.520, which impleme nts section
314(a) of the USA PATRIOT  Act.  At a minimum, the procedures should accomplish the
following:
•Designate a point of contact for receiving information requests.
•Ensure that the confidentiality of requested information is safeguarded.
•Establish a process for responding to FinCEN’ s requests.
•Establish a process for determining if and when a SAR should be filed.
3. Determine whether the search policies, procedures, and processes the financial institution
uses to respond to section 314(a) requests are comprehensive and cover all records
identified in the General Instructions for such requests.  The General Instructions includesearching accounts maintained by the named subject during the preceding 12 months andtransactions conducted within the last six months .  Financial institutions have 14 days
from the transmission date of the request to respond to a section 314(a) Subject
Information Form.
4.If the financial institution uses a third -party vendor to perform or facilitate searches,
determine whether  an agreement or procedures are in place to ensure confidentiality.
5.Review the financial institution ’s internal controls and determine whether its
documentation to evidence compliance with section 314(a) requests is adequate.  Thisdocumentation could include, for example, the following:
•Copies of section 314(a) requests.
•A log that records the tracking numbers and includes a sign- off column.

Information Sharing — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  98 2/27/2015.V2  •Copies of SISS -generated search self -verification documents.
•If appropriate, request documentation from FinCEN regarding the bank’s history of
accessing the SISS.
•For positive matches, copies of the form returned to FinCEN (e.g., SISS -generated
Subject Response Lists) and the supporting documentation should be retained.
Voluntary Information Sharing (Section 314(b))  
6.D etermine whether the financial institution has decided to share information voluntarily .
If so, verify that the financial institution has filed a notification form with FinCEN andprovides an effective date for the sharing of information that is within the previous 12
months.
7. Verify that the financial institution has policies, procedures, and processes for sharing
information and receiving shared information, as specified under 31 CFR 1010.540,(which implements section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT  Act).
8. Financial institutions that choose to share information voluntarily should have policies,
procedures, and processes to document compliance; maintain adequate internal controls;
provide ongoing training; and independently test its compliance with 31 CFR 1010.540.
At a minimum, the procedures should:
•Designate a point of contact for receiving and providing information.
•Ensure the safeguarding and confidentiality of information received and information
requested.
•Establish a process for sending and responding to requests, including ensuring that
other parties with whom the financial institution intends to share information
(including affiliates) have filed the proper notice.
•Establish procedures for determining whether and when a SAR should be filed.
9.If the financial institution is sharing information with other entities and is not following
the procedures outlined in 31 CFR 1010.540(b) , notify the examiners reviewing the
privacy rules.
10. Through a review of the financial institution’s documentation (including account
analysis) on a sample of the information shared and received, evaluate how the financialinstitution determined whether a SAR was warranted .  The financial institution is not
required to file SARs solely on the basis of information obtained through the section314(b) voluntary information sharing process.  In fact, the information obtained throughthe section 314(b) voluntary information sharing process may enable the financial
institution to determine that no SAR is required for transact ions that may have initially
appeared suspicious.  The financial institution should have considered account activity in
determining whether a SAR was warranted.

Information Sharing — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  99 2/27/2015.V2  Transaction Testing  
11. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the financial
in
stitution ’s audit findings, select a sample of positive matches or recent requests to
determine whether the following requirements have been met:
•The financial institution ’s policies, procedures, and processes enable it to search all of
the records identified in the General Instructions for section 314(a) requests.  Such
processes may be electronic, manual, or both.
•The financial institution searches appropriate records for each information request
received .  For positive matches:
− Verify that a response was provided to FinCEN within the designated time period
(31 CFR 1010.520(b)(3)(ii). 
− Review the financial institution ’s documentation (including account analysis) to 
evaluate how the financial institution determined whether a SAR was  warranted .  
Financial institutions are not required to file SARs solely on the basis of a match 
with a named subject; instead, account activity should be considered in 
determining whether a SAR is warranted.  
The financial institution uses information only in the manner and for the purposes allowed 
and keeps information secure and confidential (31 CFR 1010.520(b)(3) (iv).  (This 
requirement can be verified through discussions with management.) 
12. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the ability of policies, procedures, and processes to meet regulatory
requirements associated with information sharing.

Purchase and Sale of Monetary Instruments Record Keeping — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  100 2/27/2015.V2  Purchase and Sale of Monetary Instruments Recordkeeping — 
Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the 
recording of information required for the purchase and sale of monetary instruments for 
currency in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000, inclusive.  This section covers the regulatory requirements as set forth by the BSA.  Refer to the expanded sections of this manual for additional discussions and procedures on specific money laundering risks for 
purchase and sale of monetary inst ruments activities.  
Banks sell a variety of monetary instruments (e.g., bank checks or drafts, including foreign 
drafts, money orders, cashier’s checks, and traveler’ s checks) in exchange for currency .  
Purchasing these instruments in amounts of less than $10,000 is a common method used by money launderers to evade large currency transaction reporting requirements.  Once converted from currency, criminals typically deposit these instruments in accounts with other banks to facilitate the movement of funds through the payment system.  In many cases, the 
persons involved do not have an account with the bank from which the instruments are 
purchased. 
Purchaser Verification  
Under 31 CFR 1010.415 banks are required to verify the identity of persons purchasing 
monetary instruments for currency in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000, inclusive, and to 
maintain records of all such sales.  
Banks may either verify that the purchaser of monetary instruments is a deposit 
accountholder with identifying information on record with the bank, or a bank may verify the identity of the purchaser by viewing a form of identification that contains the customer’ s 
name and address and that the financial community accepts as a means of identification when cashing checks for noncustomers.  The bank must obtain additional information for purchasers who do not have deposit accounts.  The method used to verify the identity of the 
purchaser must be recorded. 
Acceptable Identif ication 
The U.S. Treasury ’s Administrative Ruling 92 -1 provides guidance on how a bank can verify 
the identity of an elderly or disabled customer who does not possess the normally acceptable 
forms of identification .  A bank may accept a Social Security , Medicare, or Medicaid card 
along with another form of documentation bearing the customer’ s name and address .  
Additional forms of documentation include a utility bill, a tax bill, or a voter registration card.  The forms of alternate identification a bank decides to accept should be included in its 
formal policies, procedures, and processes. 
Contemporaneous Purchases  
Contemporaneous purchases of the same or different types of instruments totaling $3,000 or more must be treated as one purchase.  Multiple purchases during one business day totaling $3,000 or more must be aggregated and treated as one purchase if the bank has knowledge 
that the purchases have occurred.

Purchase and Sale of Monetary Instruments Record Keeping — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  101 2/27/2015.V2  Indirect Currency Purchases of Monetary Instruments  
Banks may implement a policy requiring custo mers who are deposit accountholders and who 
want to purchase monetary instruments in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000 with 
currency to first deposit the currency into their deposit accounts.  Nothing within the BSA or 
its implementing regulations prohibits a bank from instituting such a policy. 
However, FinCEN takes the position108 that when a customer purchases a monetary 
instrument in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000 using currency that the customer first 
deposits into the customer’s account, the transa ction is still subject to the recordkeeping 
requirements of 31 CFR 1010.415.  This requirement applies whether the transaction is conducted in accordance with a bank’s established policy or at the request of the customer.  Generally, when a bank sells monetary instruments to deposit accountholders, the bank already maintain s most of the information required by 31 CFR 1010.415 in the normal course 
of its business. 
Recordkeeping and Retention Requirements  
Under 31 CFR 1010.415, a bank ’s records of sales must contain, at a minimum, the 
following information: 
•If the purchaser has a deposit account  with the bank:
− Name of the purchaser.
− Date of purchase.
− Types of instruments purchased.
− Serial numbers of each of the instruments purchased.
− Dollar amounts of each of the instruments purchased in currency.
− Specific identifying information, if applicable.109
•I
f the purchaser does not have a deposit account with the bank:
–Name and address of the purchaser.
–Social Security or alien identification number of the purchaser.
–Date of birth of the purchaser.
–Date of purchase.
108 FinCEN’s Guidance on Interpreting Financial Institution Policies in Relation to Recordkeeping 
Requirements under 31 CFR 103.29 , November 2002. 
109 The bank must verify that  the person is a deposit accountholder or must verify the person’s identity.  
Verification may be either through a signature card or other file or record at the bank, provided the deposit 
accountholder’s name and address were verified previously and that i nformation was recorded on the signature 
card or other file or record, or by examination of a document that is normally acceptable within the banking community and that contains the name and address of the purchaser.  If the deposit accountholder’s identit y has 
not been verified previously, the bank shall record the specific identifying information (e.g., state of issuance and number of driver’s license) of the document examined.

–Serial numbers of each of the instruments purchased.
–Dollar amounts of each of the instruments purchased.
–Specific identifying information for verifying the purchaser’ s identity  (e.g., state of
issuance and number on driver’ s license).
If the purchaser cannot provide the required information at the time of the transaction or 
through the bank’s own previously verified records, the transaction should be refused.  The records of monetary instrument sales must be retained for five years and be available to the 
appropriate agencies upon request.

Purchase and Sale of Monetary Instruments Record Keeping — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  103 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Purchase and Sale of Monetary Instrum ents Recordkeeping  
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the 
recording of information required for the purchase and sale of monetary instruments for 
currency in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000, inclusive.  This section covers the regulatory requirements as set forth by the BSA.  Refer to the expanded sections of this manual for additional discussions and procedures on specific money laundering risks for 
purchase and sale of monetary instruments activities. 
1. Determine whether the bank maintains the required records (in a manual or an automated
system) for sales of bank checks or drafts including foreign drafts, cashier ’s checks,
money orders, and traveler’s checks for currency in amounts between $3,000 and
$10,000, inclusive, to purchasers who have deposit accounts with the bank.
2.Determine whether the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes permit currency sales
of monetary instruments to purchasers who do not have deposit accounts with the bank(nondepositors ):
If so, determine whether the bank maintains the required records for sales of monetary instruments to nondepositors. 
If not permitted, determine whether the bank allows sales on an exception basis. 
Transaction Testing  
3. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
a
udit findings, select a sample of monetary instruments sold for currency in amounts
between $3,000 and $10,000, inclusive, to determine whether the bank obtains, verifies,
and retains the required records to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
4. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the ability of policies, procedures, and processes to meet regulatoryrequirements associated with the purchase and sale of monetary instruments.
5. On the basis of the previous conclusion and the risks associated with the bank’ s activity
in this area, proceed to expanded examination procedures, if necessary.

Funds Transfers Record Keeping — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  104 2/27/2015.V2  Funds Transfers Recordkeeping — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for 
funds transfers.  This section covers the regulatory requirements as set forth in the BSA.  
Refer to the expanded sections of this manual for discussions and procedures regarding 
specific money laundering risks for funds transfer activities. 
Funds transfer systems enable the instantaneous transfer of funds, including both domestic 
and cross- border transfers .  Consequently these systems can present an attractive method to 
disguise the source of funds derived from illegal activity.  The BSA was amended by the Annunzio–Wylie Anti- Money Laundering Act of 1992 to authorize the U.S. Treasury and the 
Federal Reserve Board to prescribe regulations for domestic and international funds transfers. 
In 1995, the U.S. Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued 
a final rule on recordk eeping requirements concerning payment orders by banks (31 CFR 
1010.410.
110 The rule requires each bank involved in funds transfers111 to collect and retain 
certain information in connection with funds transfers of $3,000 or more.112 The information 
required to be collected and retained depends on the bank’s role in the particular funds transfer (originator’s bank, intermediary bank, or beneficiary’s bank).
113 The requirements 
may also vary depending on whether an originator or beneficiary is an established customer 
of a bank and whether a payment order is made in person or otherwise. 
Also in 1995, the U.S. Treasury issued a final rule that requires all financial institutions to 
include certain information in transmittal orders for funds transfers of $3,000 or more (31 
CFR 1010.410).114 This requirement is commonly referred to as the “ Travel Rule. ” 
110 31 CFR 1020.410(a)  is the recordkeeping rule for banks, and 31 CFR 1010.410(e) imposes similar 
requirements for nonbank financial institutions that engage in funds transfers.  The procedures in this core 
overview section address only the rules for banks in 31 CFR 1020.410(a) . 
111 Funds transfer is defined under 31 CFR 1010.100.  Funds transfers governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer 
Act of 1978, as well as any other funds transfers that are made through an automated clearing house, an 
automated teller machine, or a point -of-sale system, are excluded from this definition and exempt from the 
requirements of 31 CFR 1020.410(a), and 31 CFR 1010.410(e) and (f) . 
112 31 CFR 1020.410(a )(6) provides exceptions to the funds transfer requirements.  Funds transfers where both 
t
he 
originator and the beneficiary are the same person and the originator’s bank and the beneficiary’s bank are 
the same bank are not subject to the recordkeeping requirements for funds transfers.  Additionally, exceptions 
are provided from the recordkeeping requirements for funds transfers where the originator and beneficiary are: a 
bank; a wholly owned domestic subsidiary of a bank chartered in the United States; a broker or dealer in 
securities; a wholly owned domestic subsidiary of a broker or de aler in securities; the United States; a state or 
local government; or a federal, state or local government agency or instrumentality.  
113 These terms are defined under 31 CFR 1010.100 .  
114 The rule applies to both banks and nonbanks (31 CFR 1010.410(f).  Bec ause it is broader in scope, the 
Travel Rule uses more expansive terms, such as “transmittal order” instead of “payment order” and 
“transmittor’s financial institution” instead of “originating bank.” The broader terms include the bank -specific 
terms.

Funds Transfers Record Keeping — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  106 2/27/2015.V2  Payment Orders Not Made in Person  
If a payment order is not made in person, the originator’s bank must obtain and retain the 
following records: 
•Name and address of the person placing the payment order.
•The person’ s TIN (e.g., SSN or EIN) or, if none, the alien identification number or

and a copy or record of the method of payment (e.g., check or credit card transaction) forthe funds transfer.  If the  originator’s bank has knowledge that the person placing the
payment order is not the originator, the originator’s bank must obtain and record theoriginator’s TIN (e.g., SSN or EIN) or, if none, the alien identification number or
passport number and country of issuance, or a notation of the lack thereof.
Retrievability  
Information retained must be retrievable by reference to the name of the originator .  When 
the originator is an established customer of the bank and has an account used for funds 
transfers, information retained must also be retrievable by account number (31 CFR 
1020.410(a)(4).  Records must be maintained for five years. 
Travel Rule Requirement  
For funds transmittals of $3,000 or more, the transmittor’ s financial institution must include 
the following information in the transmittal order at the time that a transmittal order is sent to 
a receiving financial institution ( 1010.410(f)(1)): 
•Name of the transmittor, and, if the payment is ordered from an account, the accountnumber of the transmittor .
•Address of the transmittor.
•Amount of the transmittal order.
•Date of the transmittal order.
•Identity of the recipient’ s financial institution.
•As many of the following items as are received with the transmittal order:
–Name and address of the recipient.
–Account number of the recipient.
–Any other specific identifier of the recipient.
•Either the name and address or the numerical identifier of the transmittor ’s financial
institution.
There are no recordkeeping requirements in the Travel Rule.

Funds Transfers Record Keeping — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  107 2/27/2015.V2  Responsibilities of Intermediary Institutions  
Recordkeeping Requirements  
For each payment order of $3,000 or more that a bank accepts as an intermediary bank, the 
bank must retain a record of the payment order. 
Travel Rule Requirements  
For funds transmittals of $3,000 or more, the intermediary financial institution must include 
the following information if received from the sender in a transmittal order at the time that 
order is sent to a receiving financial institution ( 1010.410(f)(2): 
•Name and account number of the trans mittor.
•Address of the transmittor.
•Amount of the transmittal order.
•Date of the transmittal order.
•Identity of the recipient’ s financial institution.
•As many of the following items as are received with the transmittal order:
–Name and address of the recipient.
–Account number of the recipient.
–Any other specific identifier of the recipient.
•Either the name and address or the numerical identifier of the transmittor ’s financial
institution.
Intermediary financial institutions must pass on all of the informatio n received from a 
transmittor ’s financial institution or the preceding financial institution, but they have no duty 
to obtain information not provided by the transmittor’ s financial institution or the preceding 
financial institution.  
Responsibilities of Beneficiary ’s Banks 
Recordkeeping Requirements  
For each payment order of $3,000 or more that a bank accepts as a beneficiary’s bank, the 
bank must retain a record of the payment order. 
If the beneficiary is not an established customer of the bank, the benefi ciary ’s institution 
must retain the following information for each payment order of $3,000 or more. 
Proceeds Delivered in Person  
If proceeds are delivered in person to the beneficiary or its representative or agent, the 
institution must verify the identity  of the person receiving the proceeds and retain a record of 
the following: 
--- Page 113 ---
Funds Transfers Record Keeping — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  108 2/27/2015.V2  •Name and address.
•The type of document reviewed.
•The number of the identification document.
•The person’s TIN, or, if none, the alien identification number or passport number and
country of issuance, or a notation in the record of the lack thereof.
•If the institution has knowledge that the person receiving the proceeds is not the
beneficiary, the institution must obtain and retain a record of the beneficiary’ s name and
address, as well as the beneficiary ’s identification.
Proceeds Not Delivered in Person  
If proceeds are not delivered in person, the institution must retain a copy of the check or 
other instrument used to effect the payment, or the institution must record the information on the instrument.  The institution must also record the name and address of the person to whom 
it was sent.  
Retrievability  
Information retained must be retrievable by reference to the name of the beneficiary .  When 
the beneficiary is an established customer of the institution and has an account used for funds 
transfers, information retained must also be retrievable by account number (31 CFR 1020.410(a) (4). 
There are no Travel Rule requirements for beneficiary banks.  
Abbreviations and Addresses 
Although the Travel Rule does not permit the use of coded names or pseudonyms, the rule 
does allow the use of abbreviated names, names reflecting different accounts of a corporation (e.g., XYZ Payroll Account), and trade and assumed names of a business (doing business as) 
or the names of unincorporated divisions or departments of the business. 
Customer Address  
The term “address, ” as used in 1010.410(f), is not defined.  Previously issued guidance from 
FinCEN had been interpreted as not allowing the use of mailing addresses in a transmittal 
order when a street address is known to the transmittor’ s financial institution .  However, in 
the November 28, 2003, Federal Register  notice,115 FinCEN issued a regulatory 
interpretation that states the Travel Rule should allow th e use of mailing addresses, including 
post office boxes, in the transmittor address field of transmittal orders in certain circumstances.  
The regulatory interpretation states that, for purposes of 1010.410(f) , the term “address ” 
means either the transmittor ’s street address or the transmittor ’s address maintained in the 
financial institution ’s automated CIF (such as a mailing address including a post office box) 
115 68 Fed. Reg. 66708 (November 23, 2003).

Funds Transfers Record Keeping — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  109 2/27/2015.V2  as long as the institution maintains the transmittor ’s address116 on file and the address 
information is retrievable upon request by law enforcement. 
116 Consistent with 31 CFR 1020.220, an “address” for purposes of the Travel Rule is as follows: for an 
individual, “address” is a residential or business street address, an Army Post Office Box or a Fleet Post Office 
Box, or the residential or business street address of next of kin or another contact person for persons who do not 
have a residential or business address.  For a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, partnership, or trust), “address” is a pr incipal place of business, local office, or other physical location.  However, while 31 
CFR 1020.220 applies only to new customers opening accounts on or after October 1, 2003, and while the rule 
exempt funds transfers from the definition of “account,” for  banks, the Travel Rule applies to all transmittals of 
funds of $3,000 or more, whether or not the transmittor is a customer for purposes of 31 CFR 1020.22 0.

Funds Transfers Rec ord Keeping — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  110 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Funds Transfers  Recordkeeping  
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for 
funds transfers.  This section covers the regulatory requirements as set forth in the BSA.  
Refer to the expanded sections of this manual for discussions and procedures regarding 
specific money laundering risks for funds transfer activiti es. 
1. Verify that the bank obtains and maintains appropriate records for compliance with 31
CFR 1020.410(a).
2.Verify that the bank transmits payment information as required by 31 CFR 1010.410(f)
(the “Travel Rule” ).
3.Verify that the bank files CTRs  when currency is received or dispersed in a funds transfer
that exceeds $10,000 (31 CFR 1010.311).
4. If the bank sends or receives funds transfers to or from institutions in other countries,
especially those with strict privacy and secrecy laws, assess whet her the bank has
policies, procedures, and processes to determine whether amounts, the frequency of the
transfer, and countries of origin or destination are consistent with the nature of the
business or occupation of the customer.
Transaction Testing  
5.On t he basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
audit findings, select a sample of funds transfers processed as an originator’s bank, an
intermediary bank, and a beneficiary’s bank to ensure the institution collects, maintains,
or transmits the required information, depending on the institution’ s role in the transfer.
6. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the ability of policies, procedures, and proc esses to meet regulatory
requirements associated with funds transfers.
7. On the basis of the previous conclusion and the risks associated with the bank’ s activity
in this area, proceed to expanded examination procedures, if necessary.

Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Due Diligence — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  111 2/27/2015.V2  Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping , Reporting , and 
Due Diligence — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for 
correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks, foreign correspondent account record 
keeping, and due diligence programs to detect and report money laundering and suspicious activity .  Assess the bank’s compliance with the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, 
Accountability, and Divestment Act (CISADA) , if applicable.  Refer to the expanded sections 
of the manual for discussions and examination procedures regarding specific money 
laundering risks associated with foreign correspondent accounts.  
One of the central goals of the USA PATRIOT Act was to protect access to the U.S. financial 
system by requiring  certain records , reports, and due diligence programs for foreign 
correspondent accounts.  I n addition, the USA PATRIOT Act prohibits accounts with foreign 
shell banks.  Foreig n correspondent accounts, as noted in past U.S. Senate investigative 
reports,117 are a gateway into the U.S. financial system .  This section of the manual covers

Foreign Shell Bank Prohibition and 
Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping 
For purposes of 31 CFR 1010.630 and 1010.670, a “correspondent account ” is an account 
established by a bank for a foreign bank to receive deposits from, or to make payments or 
other disbursements on behalf of the foreign bank, or to handle other financial transactions 
related to the foreign bank .  An “account” means any formal banking or business relationship 
established to provide regular services, dealings, and other financial transactions.  It includes 
a demand deposit, savings deposit, or other transaction or asset account and a credit account or other extension of credit (31 CFR 1010.605(c) .  Accounts maintained by foreign banks for 
financial institutions covered by the rule are not “correspondent accounts” subject to this 
regulation.

Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Due Diligence — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  112 2/27/2015.V2  Under 31 CFR 1010.630, a bank is prohibited from establishing, maintaining, administering, 
or managing a  correspondent account in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign shell 
bank.  A foreign shell bank is defined as a foreign bank without a physical presence in any country.
119 An exception, however, permits a bank to maintain a correspondent account for a 
foreign shell bank that is a regulated affiliate.120 31 CFR 1010.630 also requires that a bank 
take reasonable steps to ensure that any correspondent account established, maintained, administered, or managed in the United States for a foreign bank is not being used by that 
foreign bank to provide banking services indirectly to foreign shell banks. 
Certifications 
A bank that maintains a correspondent account in the United States for a foreign bank must 
maintain records in the United States identifying the owners of each foreign bank.121 A bank 
must also record the name and street address of a person who resides in the United States and who is authorized, and has agreed, to be an agent to accept service of legal process.
122 Under 
31 CFR 1010.670, a bank must produce these records within seven days upon receipt of a 
written request from a federal law enforcement officer.  
The U.S. Treasury, working with the industry and federal banking and law enforcement 
agencies, developed a “certification process ” to assist banks in complying with the 
recordkeeping provisions.  This process includes certification and recertification forms .  
While banks are not required to use these forms, a bank is  “deemed to be in compliance” 
with the regulation if it obtains a completed certification form from the foreign bank and 
receives a recertification  on or before the three-year anniversary of the execution of the initial 
or previous certification.123 
119 “Physical presence” means a place of business that:  
•Is maintained by a foreign bank.
•Is located at a fixed address (other than solely an electronic address or a post office box) in a country i n
w
hich the foreign financial institution is authorized to conduct banking activities, at which location the
foreign financial institution:
•Employs one or more persons on a full -time basis.
•Maintains operating records related to its banking activities.
•Is subject to inspection by the banking authority that licensed the foreign financial institution to conduct
banking activities.
120 A “regulated affiliate” is a shell bank that is affiliated with a depository institution, credit union, or foreign  
bank that maintains a physical presence in the United States or in another jurisdiction.  The regulated affiliate 
shell bank must also be subject to supervision by the banking authority that regulates the affiliated entity.  
121 To minimize the recordkeeping  burdens, ownership information is not required for foreign financial 
institutions that file a form FR Y -7 (Annual Report of Foreign Banking Organizations ) with the Federal Reserve 
or for those foreign financial institutions that are publicly traded.  “Pub licly traded” refers to shares that are 
traded on an exchange or an organized over -the-counter market that is regulated by a foreign securities authority 
as defined in section 3(a)(50) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
122 “Service of legal process” me ans that the agent is willing to accept legal documents, such as subpoenas, on 
behalf of the foreign bank.  
123 Refer to Frequently Asked Questions, Foreign Bank Recertifications under 31 CFR 103.177 , FIN -2006-
G003, February 3, 2006.

Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Due Diligence — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  113 2/27/2015.V2  Account Closure  
The regulation also contains specific provisions as to when banks must obtain the required 
information or close correspondent accounts.  Banks must obtain certifications (or recertifications) or otherwise obtain the required information within 30 calendar days after the date an account is established and at least once every three years thereafter .  If the bank is 
unable to obtain the required information, it must close all correspondent accounts with the 
foreign bank within a commercially reasonable time.  
Verification 
A bank should review certifications for reasonableness and accuracy .  If a bank at any time 
knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that any information contained in a certification (or 
recertification), or that any other information it relied on is no longer cor rect, the bank must 
request that the foreign bank verify or correct such information, or the bank must take other 
appropriate measures to ascertain its accuracy .  Therefore, banks should review certifications 
for potential problems that may warrant further  review, such as use of post office boxes or 
forwarding addresses .  If the bank has not obtained the necessary or corrected information 
within 90 days, it must close the account within a commercially reasonable time .  During this 
time, the bank may not per mit the foreign bank to establish any new financial positions or 
execute any transactions through the account, other than those transactions necessary to close the account.  Also, a bank may not establish any other correspondent account for the foreign 
bank until it obtains the required information. 
A bank must also retain the original of any document provided by a foreign bank, and retain 
the original or a copy of any document otherwise relied on for the purposes of the regulation, for at least five years after the date that the bank no longer maintains any correspondent 
account for the foreign bank . 
Subpoenas  
Under section 319(b) of the USA PATRIOT  Act, the Secretary of the Treasury or the U.S. 
Attorney General may issue a subpoena or summons to any foreign bank that maintains a 
correspondent account in the United States to obtain records relating to that account, including records maintained abroad, or to obtain records relating to the deposit of funds into the foreign bank.  If the foreign bank fails to comply with the subpoena or fails to initiate proceedings to contest that subpoena, the Secretary of the Treasury or the U.S. Attorney General (after consultations with each other) may, by written notice, direct a bank to terminate its relationship with a fo reign correspondent bank.  If a bank fails to terminate the 
correspondent relationship within ten days of receipt of notice, it could be subject to a civil 
money penalty of up to $10,000 per day until the correspondent relationship is terminated. 
Requests for AML Records by Federal Regulator  
Also, upon request by its federal regulator, a bank must provide or make available records 
related to AML compliance of the bank or one of its customers, within 120 hours from the 
time of the request  (31 USC 5318(k)(2)).

Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Due Diligence — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  114 2/27/2015.V2  Special Due Diligence Program for Foreign Correspondent Accounts  
Section 312 of the USA PATRIOT  Act added  subsection (i) to 31 USC 5318 of the BSA .  
This subsection requires each U.S. financial institution that establishes, maintains, 
administers,  or man ages a correspondent account in the United States  for a foreign financial 
institution  to take certain AML  measures  for such accounts .  In addition, section 312 of the 
USA PATRIOT  Act specifies additional standards for correspondent accounts maintained for 
certain foreign banks. 
General Due Diligence  
31 CFR 1010.610(a) requires banks to establish  a due diligence program that includes 
appropriate, specific, risk -based, and, where necessary, enhanced policies, procedures, and 
controls that are reasonably desig ned to enable the bank to detect and report, on an ongoing 
basis, any known or suspected money laundering activity conducted through or involving any 
correspondent account established, maintained, administered, or managed by the bank in the 
United States f or a foreign  financial institution124 (foreign correspondent account ). 
Due diligence policies, procedures, and controls must include each of the following: 
•Determining whether each such foreign correspondent account is subject to EDD ( refer to
“Enhanced Due Diligence ” below).
•Assessing the money laundering risks presented by each such foreign correspondent
account.
•Applying risk-based procedures and controls to each such foreign correspondent account
reasonably designed to detect and report known or suspected money laundering activity,
including a periodic review of the correspondent account activity sufficient to determineconsistency with information obtained about the type, purpose, and anticipated activity of
the account.
Risk assessment of foreign financi al institutions .  A bank’ s general due diligence program 
must include policies, procedures, and processes to assess the risks posed by the bank’ s 
foreign financial institution customers .  A bank’ s resources are most appropriately directed at 
those accounts that pose a more significant money laundering risk.  The bank’ s due diligence 
program should provide for the risk assessment of foreign correspondent accounts 
considering all relevant factors, including, as appropriate:  
•The nature of the foreign financial  institution ’s business and the markets it serves.
•The type, purpose, and anticipated activity of the foreign correspondent account.
124 The term “foreign financial institution” as defined in 31 CFR 1010.605(f) generally includes:  
•A foreign bank.
•A foreign branch or office of a U.S. bank, broker/dealer in securities, futures commission merchant,
introducing broker, or mutual fund.
•Any other person organized under foreign law that, if located in the United States, would be a
broker/dealer in securities, futures commission merchant, introducing broker, or mutual fund.
•Any person  organized under foreign law that is engaged in the business of, and is readily identifiable as,
a currency dealer or exchanger or a money transmitter.

Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Due Diligence — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  115 2/27/2015.V2  •The nature and duration of the bank’ s relationship with the foreign financial institution
(and, if relevant, with any affil iate of the foreign financial institution).
•The AML and supervisory regime of the jurisdiction that issued the charter or license to
the foreign financial institution and, to the extent that information regarding suchjurisdiction is reasonably available, of the jurisdiction in which any company that is an
owner of the foreign financial institution is incorporated or chartered.
•Information known or reasonably available to the bank about the foreign financial
institution ’s AML record, including public information in standard industry guides,
periodicals, and major publications.
Banks are not required to evaluate all of the above factors for every correspondent account. 
Monitoring of foreign correspondent  accounts .  As part of ongoing due diligence, banks 
should periodically review their foreign correspondent accounts.  Monitoring does not, in the 
ordinary situation, involve scrutiny of every transaction taking place within the account, but, 
instead,  should involve a review of the account sufficient to ensure t hat the bank can 
determine whether the nature and volume of account activity is generally consistent with information regarding the purpose of the account and expected account activity and to ensure 
that the bank can adequately identify suspicious transactions. 
An effective due diligence program provides for a range of due diligence measures, based 
upon the bank’ s risk assessment of each foreign correspondent account .  The starting point 
for an effective due diligence program, therefore, should be a stratification of the money 
laundering risk of each foreign correspondent account based on the bank’ s review of relevant 
risk factors (such as those identified above) to determine which accounts may require 
increased measures .  The due diligence program should identify risk factors that would 
warrant the institution conducting additional scrutiny or increased monitoring of a particular account .  As due diligence is an ongoing process, a bank should take measures to ensure 
account profiles are current and monitoring should be risk- based .  Banks should consider 
whether risk profiles should be adjusted or suspicious activity reported when the activity is 
inconsistent with the profile.  
Enhanced Due Diligence  
31 CFR 1010.610(b) requires banks to establish  risk-based EDD policies , procedures , and 
controls when establishing,  maintaining , administering, or managing a correspondent account 
in the United States  for certain foreign  banks (as identified in 31 CFR 1010.610(c) operating 
under any one or more of the following: 
•An offshore banking license.125
•A
 banking license issued by a foreign country that has been designated as noncooperative
with international AML principles or procedures by an intergovernmental group or
125 The USA PATRIOT Act (31 USC 5318(i)(4)(A) and 31 CFR 1010.605(i) define an offshore banking license 
as a license to conduct banking activities that, as a condition of the license, prohibits the licensed entity from 
conducting banking activities with the citizens, or in the local currency of, the jurisdiction that issued the 
license.

United States representative to the group or organization concurs.126 
•A banking l icense issued by a foreign country that has been designated by the Secretary
of the Treasury as warranting special measures due to money laundering concerns.
If such an account is established or maintained, 31 CFR 1010.610(b) requires the bank to 
establish  EDD policies, procedures, and controls to ensure that the bank, at a minimum,  takes 
reasonable steps to:  
•Determine , for any such foreign bank whose shares are not publicly traded, the identity of
each of the owners of the foreign bank, and the nature and extent of the ownership
interest of each such owner.127
•C
onduct enhanced scrutiny of such account to guard against money laundering and to
identify and report any suspicious transactions in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations.  This enhanced scrutiny is to reflect the risk assessment of the account and
shall include, as appropriate:
–Obtaining and considering information relating to the foreign bank’s anti-money
laundering program to assess the risk of money laundering presented by the foreign
bank’s correspondent account.
–Monitoring transactions to, from, or through the correspondent account in a mannerreasonably designed to detect money laundering and suspicious activity.
–Obtaining information from the foreign bank about the identity of any person with
authority to direct transactions through any correspondent account that is a payablethrough account, and the sources and the beneficial owner of funds or other assets in
the payable through account.
•Determine whether the foreign bank for which the correspondent account is maintained in
turn maintains correspondent accounts for other foreign banks that use the foreign bank’s
correspondent account and, if so, take reasonable steps to obtain information relevant toassess and mitigate money laundering risks associated with the foreign bank’s
correspondent accounts for other foreign banks, including, as appropriate, the identity of
those foreign banks.
126 The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is the only intergovernmental organization of which the United 
States is a member that has designated countries as noncooperative with international anti -money laundering 
principles.  The United States has concurred with all FATF designat ions to date.  
127 An “owner” is any person who directly or indirectly owns, controls, or has the power to vote 10 percent or 
more of any class of securities of a foreign bank (31 CFR 1010.610(b)(3).  “Publicly traded” means shares that 
are traded on an exchange or an organized over -the-counter market that is regulated by a foreign securities 
authority, as defined in section 3(a)(50) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 USC  78c(a)(50)) 
(1010.610(b)(3).   Guidance on Obtaining and Retaining Beneficial Ownership Information , was issued by 
FinCEN, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National 
Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, and 
Securities and Exchange Commission, in consultation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in 
May 2010,  The guidance consolidates existing regulatory expectations for obt aining beneficial ownership 
information for certain accounts and customer relationships.  
--- Page 122 ---
Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Due Diligence — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  117 2/27/2015.V2  In addition to those categories of foreign banks identified in the regulation  as requiring EDD, 
banks may find it appropriate to conduct additional due diligence measures on foreign 
financial institutions identified through application of the bank’ s general due diligence 
program as posing a higher  risk for money laundering.  Such measures may include any o r all 
of the elements of EDD set forth in the regulation , as appropriate for the risks posed by the 
specific foreign correspondent account. 
As also noted in the above section on general due diligence, a bank’s resources are most appropriately directed at t hose accounts that pose a more significant money laundering risk.  
Accordingly, where a bank is required or otherwise determines that it is necessary to conduct EDD in connection with a foreign correspondent account, the bank may consider the risk assessme nt factors discussed in the section on general due diligence when determining the 
extent of the EDD that is necessary and appropriate to mitigate the risks presented .  In 
particular, the anti -money laundering and supervisory regime of the jurisdiction that issued a 
charter or license to the foreign financial institution may be especially relevant in a bank’s determination of the nature and extent of the risks posed by a foreign correspondent account 
and the extent of the EDD  to be applied. 
Special Procedure s When Due Diligence Cannot Be Performed  
A bank’s due diligence policies, procedures, and controls established pursuant to 31 CFR 
1010.610 must include procedures to be followed in circumstances when appropriate due diligence or EDD cannot be performed  with respect to a foreign correspondent account, 
including when the bank should: 
•Refuse to open the account.
•Suspend transaction activity.
•File a SAR.
•Close the account.
Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 
2010 Reporting Requirements  
The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (CISADA) was 
signed into law on July 1, 2010.128  CISADA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to  
prohibit or impose strict conditions on the opening or maintaining in the United States of 
correspondent accounts and payable through accounts for foreign financial institutions that the Secretary determines have knowingly engaged in sanctionable activities.  
O
n October 11, 2011, FinCEN issued a final rule implementing reporting requirements under 
section 104(e)(1)(B) of CISADA (31 CFR 1060.300).129  It is important to note that FinCEN 
will invoke CISADA reporting requirements in very limited instances, as necessary, to elicit valuable information.  The final rule requires U.S. banks to report the following information upon receiving a written request from FinCEN: 
128 Pub. L. No. 111 -195, 124 Stat. 1312 (2010).  
129 Refer to 76 Fed. Reg.  62607 (October 11, 2011). Also available at the FinCEN Web site .

he U.S. bank must report to FinCEN within 45 calendar days regardless of the foreign 
bank’s response ( e.g. positive response, negative response, incomplete response, or no 
response).  If information is received from a foreign bank after the 45 calendar day deadline, the U.S. bank must report to FinCEN within 10 calendar days after receipt.  The rule also requires the U.S. bank to report to FinCEN instances in which it does not maintain a correspondent account for the specified foreign bank.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  119 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping , Reporting , and Due 
Diligence  
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for 
correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks, foreign correspondent account record 
keeping, and due diligence programs to detect and report money laundering and suspicious activity . Assess the bank’s compliance with the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, 
Acco untability, and Divestment Act (CISADA), if applicable.  Refer to the expanded sections 
of the manual for discussions and examination procedures regarding specific money 
laundering risks associated with foreign correspondent accounts.  
1.Determine whether the bank engages in foreign correspondent banking.
Foreign Shell Bank Prohibition and  
Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping 
2. If so, review the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes.  At a minimum, policies,
procedures, and process es should accomplish the following:
•Prohibit dealings with foreign shell banks and specify the responsible party for
obtaining, updating, and managing certifications or information for foreign
correspondent accounts.
•Identify foreign correspondent accounts and address the sending, tracking, receiving,
and reviewing of certification requests or requests for information.
•Evaluate the quality of information received in responses to certification requests orrequests for information.
•Determine whether and when a SAR  should be filed.
•Maintain sufficient internal controls.
•Provide for ongoing training.
•Independently test the bank’ s compliance with 31 CFR 1010.630.
3. Determine whether the bank has on file a current certification or current information (that
would otherwise include the information contained within a certification) for each foreigncorrespondent account to determine whether the foreign correspondent is not a foreign
shell bank (31 CFR 1010.610(a) ).
4.If the bank has foreign branches, determine whether  the bank has taken reasonable steps
to ensure that any correspondent accounts maintained for its foreign branches are notused to indirectly provide banking services to a foreign shell bank.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  120 2/27/2015.V2  procedures, and controls for correspondent accounts established, maintained, 
administered, or managed in the United States for foreign financial institutions (foreign correspondent account).  The general due diligence program must be applied to each 
foreign correspondent account.  Verify that due diligence policies, procedures, and 
controls include: 
•Determining whether any foreign correspondent account is subject to EDD (31 CFR
1010.610(a)(1)).
•Assessing the money laundering risks presented by the foreign correspondent account(31 CFR 1010.610(a)(2)).
•Applying risk -based procedures and controls to each foreign correspondent account
reasonably designed to detect and report known or suspected money launderingactivity, including a periodic review of the correspondent account activity sufficientto determine consistency with information obtained about the type, purpose, and
anticipated activity of the account ( 31 CFR 1010.610(a)(3) ).
6. Review the due diligence program’s policies, procedures, and processes governing the
BSA/AML risk assessment of foreign correspondent accounts (31 CFR 1010.610(a)).
Verify that the bank ’s due diligence program considers the following factors, as
appropriate, as criteria in the risk assessment :
•The nature of the foreign financial institution ’s business and the markets it serves.
•The type, purpose, and anticipated activity of the foreign correspondent account.
•The nature and duration of the bank’ s relationship with the foreign financial
institution and any of its affiliates.
•The AML  and supervisory regime of the jurisdiction that issued the charter or license
to the foreign financial institution, and, to the extent that information regarding such
jurisdiction is reasonably available, of t he jurisdiction in which any company that is
an owner of the foreign financial institution is incorporated or chartered.
•Information known or reasonably available to the bank about the foreign financialinstitution ’s AML record.
7. Ensure the program is reasonably designed to:
•Detect and report , on an ongoing basis, known or suspected money laundering
activity.
•Perform periodic reviews of correspondent account activity to determine consistency
with the information obtained about the type, purpose, and antic ipated activity of the
account.
8. For foreign banks subject to EDD, evaluate the criteria that the U.S. bank uses to guard
against money laundering in, and report suspicious activity in connection with, any
correspondent accounts held by such foreign banks .  Verify that the EDD  procedures are
applied to each correspondent account established for foreign banks operating under:
--- Page 126 ---
Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Due Diligence — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  121 2/27/2015.V2  •An offshore banking license.
•A banking license issued by a foreign country that has been designated as
noncooperative with international AML principles or procedures by an
intergovernmental group or organization of which the United States is a member, andwith which designation the United States representative to the group or organization
concurs.
•A banking license issued by a foreign country that has been designated by the
Secretary of the Treasury as warranting special measures due to AML concerns.
9. Review the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes and determine whether they
include reasonable steps for conducting enhanced scrutiny of foreign correspondentaccounts to guard against money laundering and to identify and report any suspicioustransactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations (31 CFR1010.610(b)(1)).  Verify that this enhanced scrutiny reflects the risk assessment of eachforeign correspondent account that is subject to such scrutiny and includes, as
appropriate:
•Obtaining and considering information relating to the foreign bank’s anti-money
laundering program to assess the risk of money laundering presented by the foreign
bank’s correspondent account (31 CFR 1010.610(b)(1)(i) ).
•Monitoring transactions to, from, or through the correspondent account in a manner
reasonably designed to detect money laundering and suspicious activity ( 31 CFR
1010.610(b)(1)(ii) ).
•Obtaining information from the foreign bank about the identity of any person withauthority to direct transactions through any correspondent account that is a payable
through account, and the sources and beneficial owner of funds or ot her assets in the
payable through account (31 CFR 1010.610(b)(1)(iii) ).
10.Review the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes for determining whether foreign
correspondent banks subject to EDD maintain correspondent accounts for other foreignbanks , and, if so, determine whether the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes
include reasonable steps to obtain information relevant to assess and mitigate money
laundering risks associated with the foreign correspondent bank’s correspondent accountsfor oth er foreign banks, including, as appropriate, the identity of those foreign banks (31
CFR 1010.610(b)(2) ).
11. Determine whether policies, procedures, and processes require the bank to take
reasonable steps to identify each of the owners with the power to vote 10 percent or more
of any class of securities of a nonpublicly traded foreign correspondent bank for which it
opens or maintains an account that is  subject to EDD.  For such accounts, evaluate the
bank’s policies, procedures, and processes to determine each such owner ’s interest  (31
CFR 1010.610(b)(3)).

review the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for responding to FinCEN’s written
request.  It is important to note that FinCEN will invoke CISADA reporting requirements
in very limited instances, as necessary, to elicit valuable information.  At a m inimum,
policies, procedures, and processes should accomplish the following:
•Responding to FinCEN’s requests within the designated time frames.
•Requesting the required information from foreign banks.
•Complying with recordkeeping requirements.
•Allowing for changes to a customer’s risk rating or profile.
Transaction Testing

Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping  
13. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
a
udit findings, select a sample of foreign bank accounts.  From the sample selected ,
determine the following:
•Whether certifications and information on the accounts are complete and reasonable.
•Whether the bank has adequate documentation to evidence that it does not maintain
accounts for, or indirectly provide services to, foreign shell banks.
•For account closures, whether closures were made within a reasonable time period
and that the relationship was not re-established without sufficient reason.
•Whether there are an y federal law enforcement requests for information regarding
foreign correspondent accounts.  If so, ascertain that requests were met in a timely
manner.
•Whether the bank received any official notifications to close a foreign f inancial
institution account.131  If so, ascertain that the accounts were closed within ten
business days.
•Whether the bank retains, for five years from the date of account closure, the original
of any document provided by a foreign financial institution, as well as the original or
a copy of any document relied on in relation to any summons or subpoena of the
foreign financial institution issued under 31 CFR 1010.670.
131 Official notifications to close a foreign financial institution’s account must be signe d by either the Secretary 
of the Treasury or the U.S. Attorney General ( 31 CFR 1010.670(d) .

14.From a sample selected, determine whether the bank consistently follows its general due
di
ligence policies, procedures, and processes for foreign correspondent accounts.  It may
be necessary to expand the sample to include correspondent accounts maintained forforeign financial institutions other than foreign banks (such as money transmitters or
currency exchangers), as appropriate.
15. From the original sample, determine whether the bank has implemented EDD  procedures
for foreign banks operating under:
•An offshore banking license.
•A banking license issued by a foreign country that has been designated as
noncooperative with international AML principles or procedures.
•A banking license issued by a foreign country that has been designated by theSecretary of the Treasury as warranting special measures due to AML concerns.
16.From a sample of accounts that are subject to EDD , verify that the bank has taken
reasonable steps, in accordance with the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes, to:
•Determine , for an y such foreign bank whose shares are not publicly traded, the
identity of each of the owners of the foreign bank with the power to vote 10 percentor more of any class of securities of the bank , and the nature and extent of the
ownership interest of each such owner.
•Conduct enhanced scrutiny of any accounts held by such banks to guard againstmoney laundering and report suspicious activity.
•Determine whether such foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other
foreign banks and, if so, obtain informat ion relevant to assess and mitigate money
laundering risks associated with the foreign bank’s correspondent accounts for other
foreign banks, including, as appropriate, the identity of those foreign banks.
17. On the basis of examination procedures complet ed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes to meet regulatory
requirements associated with foreign correspondent account record keeping and due
diligence.
18. On the basis of the previous conclusion and the risks associated with the bank’ s activity
in this area, proceed to expanded examination procedures, if necessary.

Private Banking Due Diligence Program (Non -U.S. Persons) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  125 2/27/2015.V2  Private Banking Due Diligence Program  
(Non-U.S. Persons) — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements to 
implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect and report money laundering and 
suspicious activity through private banking accounts established, administered, or maintained for non-U.S. persons.  Refer to the expanded sections of the manual for discussions and examination procedures regarding specific money laundering risks 
associated with private banking. 
Private banking can be broadly defined as providing personalized financial services to 
wealthy clients .  Section 312 of the USA PATRIOT  Act added  subsection (i) to 31 USC 
5318 of the BSA .  This subsection requires each U.S. financial institution that establishes, 
maintains, administers,  or manages a private banking account in the United States for a non-
U.S. person to take certain AML  measures  with respect to these accounts.  In particular, a 
bank must establish appropriate, specific, and, where necessary, EDD policies, procedures, and controls that are reas onably designed to enable the bank to detect and report instances of 
money laundering through such accounts.  In addition, section 312 mandates enhanced scrutiny to detect and, if appropriate, report transactions that may involve proceeds of foreign corruption for private banking accounts that are requested or maintained by or on behalf of a 
senior foreign political figure or the individual’s immediate family and close associates .  On 
January 4, 2006, FinCEN issued a final regulation (31 CFR 1010.620) to implement the 
private banking requirements of 31 USC 5318(i). 
The overview and examination procedures set forth in this section are intended to evaluate 
the bank’s due diligence program concerning private banking accounts offered to non-U.S. 
persons.  Additional procedures for specific risk areas of private banking are included in the 
expanded examination procedures, “ Private Bankin g,” page  278. 
Private Banking Accounts  
For purposes of 31 CFR 1010.620 a “private banking account” is an account (or any 
combination of accounts) maintained at a bank that satisfies all three of the following criteria : 
•Requires a minimum aggregate deposit of funds or other assets of not less than
$1 million .
•Is established on behalf of or for the benefit of one or more non-U.S. persons who aredirect or beneficial owners
132 of the account.
132 “Beneficial owner” of an account means an individual who has a level of control over, or entitlement to, the 
funds or assets in the account that, as a practical m atter, enables the individual, directly or indirectly, to control, 
manage, or direct the account.  The ability to fund the account or the entitlement to the funds of the account 
alone, however, without any corresponding authority to control, manage, or dir ect the account (such as in the 
case of a minor child beneficiary), does not cause the individual to be a beneficial owner (31  CFR 1010.605(a).  
Guidance on Obtaining and Retaining Beneficial Ownership Information , was issued by FinCEN, Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (Federal Reserve), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC), 
National Credit Union Administration  (NCUA) , Office of the Comptroller of the C urrency  (OCC) , Office of 
Thrift Supervision (OTS) , and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , in consultation with the U.S.

Private Banking Due Diligence Program (Non -U.S. Persons) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  126 2/27/2015.V2  •Is assigned to, or is administered by, in whole or in part, an officer, employee, or agent of
a bank acting as a liaison between a financial institution covered by the regulation and the
direct or beneficial owner of the account.
With regard to the minimum deposit requirement, a “private banking account” is an account 
(or combination of accounts) that requires  a minimum deposit of not less than $1 million .  A 
bank may of fer a wide range of services that are generically termed private banking, and 
even if certain (or any combination, or all) of the bank’s private banking services do not 
require  a minimum deposit of not less than $1 million , these relationships should be su bject 
to a greater level of due diligence under the bank ’s risk -based BSA/AML compliance 
program but are not subject to 31 CFR 1010.620.  Refer to the expanded overview section , 
“Private Banking ,” page 273, for further guidance . 
Due Diligence  Program  
A bank must establish and maintain a due diligence program that includes policies, 
procedures, and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report any known or 
suspected money laundering or suspicious activity conducted through or involving any private banking account for a non-U.S. person that is established, maintained, administered, or managed in the U nited States by the bank.  The due diligence program must ensure that, at 
a minimum, the bank takes reasonable steps to do each of the following: 
•Ascertain the identity of all nominal and beneficial owners of a private banking account.
•Ascertain whether the nominal or beneficial owner of any private banking account is a
senior foreign political figure.
•Ascertain the source(s) of funds deposited into a private banking account and the purpose
and expected use of the account .
•Review the activity of the account to ensure that it is consistent with the information
obtained about the client’s source of funds, and with the stated purpose and expected use
of the account, and to file a SAR,  as appropriate, to report any known or suspected
money laundering or suspicious activity conducted to, from, or through a private banking
account .
Risk Assessment of Private Banking Accounts for Non-U.S. Persons 
The nature and extent of due diligence conducted on private banking accounts for non-U.S. 
persons likely vary for each client depending on the presence of potential risk factors .  More 
extensive due diligence, for example, may be appropriate for new clients; clients who operate 
in, or whose funds are transmitted from or through, jurisdictions with weak AML  controls; 
and clients whose lines of business are primarily currency- based  (e.g., casinos or currency 
exchanger s).  Due diligence should also be commensurate with the size of the account .  
Accounts with relatively more deposits and assets should be subject to greater due diligence.  
In addition, if the bank at any time learns of information that casts doubt on previous 
information, further due diligence would be app ropriate.

expectations for obtaining beneficial ownership information for certain accounts and customer relationships.

Private Banking Due Diligence Program (Non -U.S. Persons) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  127 2/27/2015.V2  Ascertaining Source of Funds and Monitoring Account Activity  
Banks that provide private banking services generally obtain considerable information about 
their clients , including the purpose for which the customer establishes the private banking 
account.  This information can establish a baseline for account activity that enable s a bank to 
better detect suspicious activity and to assess situations where additional verification regarding the source of funds may be necessary .  Banks are not expected,  in the ordinary 
course of business, to verify the source of every deposit placed into every private banking account .  However, banks should monitor deposits and transactions as necessary to ensure 
that activity is consistent with information that the bank  has received about the client ’s 
source of funds and with the stated purpose and expected use of the account.  Such 
monitoring facilitate s the identification of accounts that warrant additional scrutiny.  
Enhanced Scrutiny of Private Banking Accounts for Se nior Foreign 
Political Figures 
For the purposes of private banking accounts under 31 CFR 1010.605(p) , the regulation 
defines the term “senior foreign political figure ” to include one or more of the following: 
•A current or former:
–Senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military, or judicial
branches of a foreign government (whether elected or not).
–Senior official of a major foreign political party.
–Senior executive of a foreign -government- owned commercial enterprise.133
•A
 corporation, business, or other entity that has been formed by, or for the benefit of, any
such individual.
•An immediate family member (including spouses, parents, siblings, children, and a
spouse’ s parents and siblings) of any such individual.
•A person who is widely and publicly known (or is actually known by the relevant bank)
to be a close associate of such individual.
Senior foreign political figures as defined above are often referred to as “ politically exposed 
persons” or PEPs .  Refer to the expanded overview section , “Politically Exposed Persons,” 
page 290, for additional guidance, in particular with respect to due diligence on accounts 
maintained for PEPs that do not meet the regulatory definition of “private banking account” 
set forth in 31 CFR 1010.605(m). 
For private banking accounts for which a senior foreign political figure is a nominal or 
beneficial owner, the bank ’s due diligence program must include enhanced scrutiny that is 
reasonably designed to detect and report transactions that may involve the proceeds of foreign corruption.  The term “proceeds of foreign corruption” means any asset or property 
that is acquired by, through, or on behalf of a senior foreign political figure through 
133 For purposes of this definition, the terms “senior official” or “senior executive” mean an individual with 
substantial authority over policy, operations, or the use of government -owned resources.

property of a foreign government, or through acts of bribery or extortion, and includes any other property into which any such assets have been transformed or converted.
134 In those 
cases when a bank files a SAR concerning a transaction th at may involve the proceeds of 
foreign corruption, FinCEN has instructed banks to include the term “foreign corruption” in 
the narrative portion of the SAR.135 
Enhanced scrutiny of private banking accounts for senior foreign political figures should be 
risk-based .  Reasonable steps to perform enhanced scrutiny may include consulting publicly 
available information regarding the home country of the client, contacting branches of the U.S. bank operating in the home country of the client  to obtain additional information about 
the client and the political environment, and  conducting greater scrutiny of the client ’s 
employment history and sources of income.  For example, funds transfers from a government account to the personal account of a government official with signature authority over the government account may raise a bank ’s suspicions of possible political corruption.  In 
addition, if a bank’ s review of  major news sources indicates that a client may be or is 
involved in political corruption, the bank should review the client’s account for unusual 
activity.  
Identifying Senior Foreign Political Figures  
Banks are required to establish policies, procedures, and controls that include reasonable 
steps to ascertain the status of an individual as a senior foreign political figure.  Procedures should require obtaining information regarding employment and other sources of income, and the bank should seek information directly from the client regarding possible senior foreign political figure status.  The bank should also check references, as appropriate, to determine whether the individual holds or has previously held a senior political position or may be a close ass ociate of a senior foreign political figure .  In addition, the bank should 
make reasonable efforts to review public sources of information regarding the client. 
Banks applying reasonable due diligence procedures in accordance with 31 CFR 1010.620 
may not be able to identify in every case individuals who qualify as senior foreign political 
figures, and, in particular, their close associates, and thus may not apply enhanced scrutiny to all such accounts .  If the bank’s due diligence program is reasonably desi gned to make this 
determination, and the bank administers this program effectively, then the bank should generally be able to detect, report, and take appropriate action when suspected money 
laundering is occurring with respect to these accounts, even in c ases when the bank has not 
been able to identify the accountholder as a senior foreign political figure warranting 
enhanced scrutiny.

listed in Guidance on Enhanced Scrutiny for Transactions That May Involve the Proceeds of Foreign Official 
Corruption, issued by the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve, FDIC , OCC , OTS , and the U.S. Department of State,

A bank’s due diligence policies, procedures, and controls established pursuant to 31 CFR 
1010.620(a) must include special procedures when appropriate due diligence cannot be 
performed .  These special procedures must include when the bank should: 
•Refuse to open the account.
•Suspend transaction activity.
•File a S AR.
•Close the account.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  130 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Private Banking Due Diligence Program 
(Non-U.S. Persons)  
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements to 
implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect and report money laundering and 
suspicious activity through private banking accounts established, administered, or maintained for non-U.S. persons.  Refer to the expanded sections of the manual for discussions and examination procedures regarding specific money laundering risks 
associated with private banking. 
1. Determine whether the bank offers private banking accounts in accordance with the
regulatory definition of a private banking account .  A private banking account means an
account (or any combination of accounts) maintained at a financial institution covered by
the regulation that satisfies all three of the following criteria :
•Requires a minimum aggregate deposit of funds or other assets of not less than
$1 million  (31 CFR 1010.605(m)(1)).
•Is established on behalf of or for the benefit of one or more non-U.S. persons who aredirect or beneficial owners of the account ( 31 CFR 1010.605(m)(2)).
•Is assigned to, or is administered or managed by, in whole or in part, an officer,
employee, or agent of the bank acting as a liaison between the bank and the direct or
beneficial owner of the account ( 31 CFR 1010.605(m)(3)).
The final rule reflects the statutory definition found in the USA PATRIOT  Act.  If an 
account satisfies the last two criteria in the definition of a private banking account as 
described above, but the institution does not require a minimum balance of $1 million , 
then the account does not qualify as a private banking account under this rule.  However, 
the account is subject to the internal controls and risk-based due diligence included in the 
institution ’s general BSA/ AML  compliance program.
136 
2. Determine whether the bank has implemented due diligence policies, procedures, and
controls for private banking accounts established, maintained, administered, or managed
in the United States by the bank for non-U.S. persons.  Determine whether the policies,
procedures, and controls are reasonably designed to detect and report any known orsuspected money laundering or suspicious activity conducted through or involving any
private banking account.
3.Review the bank’s policies, procedures, and controls to assess whether  the bank’s due
diligence program includes reasonable steps to:
•Ascer tain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of a private banking
account ( 31 CFR 1010.620(b)(1).
136 Refer to the expanded examination procedures, “Private Banking” and “Politically Expos ed Persons” (PEPs), 
pages 278 and 294, respectively, for additional guidance.

Private Banking Due Diligence Program (Non -U.S. Persons) — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  131 2/27/2015.V2  •Ascertain whether any nominal or beneficial owner of a private banking account is a
senior foreign political figure (31 CFR 1010.620(b)(2)).
•Ascertain t he source(s) of funds deposited into a private banking account and the
purpose and expected use of the private banking account for non-U.S. persons (31
CFR 1010.620(b)(3)).
•Review the activity of the account to ensure that it is consistent with the informa tion
obtained about the client’s source of funds and with the stated purpose and expected
use of the account, as needed, to guard against money laundering and to report anyknown or suspected money laundering or suspicious activity conducted to, from, or
through a private banking account for non-U.S. persons (31 CFR 1010.620(b)(4)).
4.Review the bank ’s policies, procedures, and controls for performing enhanced scrutiny to
assess whether  they are reasonably designed to detect and report transactions that may
involve the proceeds of foreign corruption
137 for which a senior foreign political figure138
i
s a nominal or beneficial owner (31 CFR 1010.620(c)(1) ).
Transaction Testing  
5. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
a
udit findings, select a sample of customer files to determine whether the bank has
ascertained the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of, and the source of funds
deposited into, private banking accounts for non-U.S. persons.  From the sample selected
determine the following:
•Whether the bank’s procedures comply with internal policies and statutory
requirements.
•Whether the bank has followed its procedures governing risk assessment of privatebanking accounts for non-U.S. persons.
•Whether the bank performs enhanced scrutiny of private banking accounts for which
senior foreign political figures are nominal or beneficial owners , consistent with its
policy, regulatory guidanc e, and statutory requirements.
137 The term “proceeds of foreign corruption” means any assets or property that is acquired by, through, or on 
behalf of a senior foreign political figure through misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement of public funds, the 
unlawful conversion of property of a foreign government, or through acts of bribery or extortion, and shall 
include any other property into which any such assets have been transformed or converted (31  CFR 
1010.620(c)(2) ).  
138 The final rule defines a senior foreign political figure as: a current or former senior official in the executive, 
legislative, administrative, military, or judicial branches of a foreign government, whether or not they are or were elected officials; a senior official of a major foreign political party; and a senior executive of a foreign government -owned commercial enterprise.  The definition also includes a corporation, business, or other entity 
formed by or for the benefit of such an individual.  Senior executives are individuals with substantial authority over policy, operations, or the use of government -owned resources.  Also included in the definition of a senior 
foreign political official are immediate family members of such individuals and persons who are widely and 
publicly known (or actually known) close associates of a senior foreign political figure.

Special Measures — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  133 2/27/2015.V2  Special Measures — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for 
special measures issued under section 311 of the USA PATRIOT  Act. 
Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT  Act added 31 USC 5318A to the BSA, which authorizes 
the Secretary of the Treasury to require domestic financial institutions and domestic financial 
agencies to take certain special measures against foreign jurisdictions, foreign financial institutions, classes of international transactions, or types of accounts of primary money laundering concern.  Section 311 provides the Secretary of the Treasury with a range of options that can be adapted to target specific money laundering and terrorist financing concerns .  Section 311 is implemented through various orders and regulations that are 
incorporated into 31 CFR Chapter X .
139 As set forth in section 311, certain special measures 
may be imposed by an order without prior public notice and comment, but such orders must 
be of limited duration and must be issued together with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 
Section 311 establishes a process for the Secretary of the Treasury to follow, and identifies 
federal agencies to consult before the Secretary of the Treasury may  conclude that a 
jurisdiction, financial institution, class of transactions, or type of account is of primary money laundering concern .  The statute also provides similar procedures, including factors 
and consultation requirements, for selecting the specif ic special measures to be imposed 
against a jurisdiction, financial institution, class of transactions, or type of account that is of 
primary money laundering concern. 
It is important to note that, while a jurisdiction, financial institution, class of tran sactions, or 
type of account may be designated of primary money laundering concern in an order issued 
together with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, special measures of unlimited duration can 
only be imposed by a final rule issued after notice and an opportunity for comment. 
Types of Special Measures  
The following five special measures can be imposed, either individually, jointly, or in any combination:  
Recordkeeping and Reporting of Certain Financial Transactions 
Under the first special measure, banks may  be required to maintain records or to file reports , 
or both, concerning the aggregate amount of transactions or the specifics of each transaction 
with respect to a jurisdiction, financial institution, class of transactions, or type of account that is of p rimary money laundering concern.  The statute contains minimum information 
requirements for these records and reports and permits the Secretary of the Treasury to 
impose additional information requirements. 
139 Notices of proposed rulemaking and final rules accompanying the determination “of primary money 
laundering concern,” and imposition o f a special measure(s) pursuant to section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act 
are on the  FinCEN Web site . 
--- Page 139 ---
Special Measures — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  134 2/27/2015.V2  Information Relating to Beneficial Ownership  
Unde r the second special measure, banks may be required to take reasonable and practicable 
steps, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, to obtain and retain information 
concerning the beneficial ownership of any account opened or maintained in the United States by a foreign person (other than a foreign entity whose shares are subject to public reporting requirements or are listed and traded on a regulated exchange or trading market), or a representative of such foreign person, that involves a jurisdic tion, financial institution, class 
of transactions, or type of account that is of primary money laundering concern. 
Information Relating to Certain Payable Through Accounts  
Under the third special measure, banks that open or maintain a payable through account in the United States  involving a jurisdiction, financial institution, class of transactions, or type 
of account that is of primary money laundering concern may be required (i) to identify each customer (and representative) who is permitted to use the account or whose transactions are routed through the account and (ii) to obtain information about each customer (and representative) that is substantially comparable to that which the bank obtains in the ordinary 
course of business with respect to its customers residing in the United States.
140 
Information Relating to Certain Correspondent Accounts  
Under the fourth special measure, banks that open or maintain a correspondent account in the United States involving a jurisdiction, financial institution, class of  transactions, or type of 
account that is of primary money laundering concern may be required to: (i) identify each customer (and representative) who is permitted to use the account or whose transactions are routed through the account; and (ii) obtain information about each such customer (and representative) that is substantially comparable to that which a United States depository institution obtains in the ordinary course of business with respect to its customers residing in 
the United States.
141 
Prohibition s or Conditions on Opening or Maintaining Certain Correspondent 
or Payable Through Accounts  
Under the fifth, and strongest, special measure, banks may be prohibited from opening or 
maintaining in the United States any correspondent account or payable through account for, 
or on behalf of, a foreign financial institution if the account involves a jurisdiction, financial institution, class of transactions, or type of account that is of primary money laundering concern .  The imposition of this measure can prohibit U.S. banks from establishing, 
maintaining, administering , or managing in the United States a correspondent or payable 
through account for, or on behalf of, any financial institution from a specific foreign 
jurisdiction .  This measure may also be applied to specific foreign financial institutions and 
their subsidiaries.  
140 Refer to expanded overview section, “Payable Through Accounts,” page 194, for additional guidance.  
141 Refer to core overview section, “Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping , Reporting  and Due 
Diligence,” pages 111, and expanded overview section, “Correspondent Accounts (Foreign),” page 177, for 
additional guidance.  
--- Page 140 ---
Special Measures — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  135 2/27/2015.V2  The regulations that implement these prohibitions may require banks to review their account 
records to determine whether they maintain no accounts directly for, or on behalf of, such 
entities .  In addition to the direct prohibition, banks may also be: 
•Prohibited from knowingly providing indirect access to the specific entities through itsother banking relationships.
•Required to notify correspondent accountholders that they must not provide the specificentity with access to the account maintained at the U.S. bank.
•Required to take reasonable steps to identify any indirect use of its accounts by thespecific entity.
Special Measures Guidance  
Orders and regulations implementing specific special measures taken under section 311 of the USA PATRIOT  Act are not static; they can be issued or rescinded over time as the 
Secretary of the Treasury determines that a subject jurisdiction, institution, class of transactions, or type of account is no longer of primary money laundering concern.  In 
addition, special measures imposed against one jurisdiction, institution, class of transactions, or type of account may vary from those imposed in other situations.  Examiners should also note that an order or rule imposing a special measure may establish a standard of due 
diligence that banks must apply to comply with the particular special measure.  
Accordingly, this manual does not detail specific final special measures, because any such 
listing could quickl y become dated .  Examiners reviewing compliance with this section 
should visit the FinCEN Web site
 for current information on final special measures.  
Examiners should only examine for those special measures that are final, and should not 
review banks for special measures  that are proposed.

Special Measures 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for 
special measures issued under section 311 of the USA PATRIOT  Act. 
1.Determine the extent of the bank ’s international banking activities and the foreign
jurisdictions in which the bank conducts tr ansactions and activities, with particular
emphasis on foreign correspondent banking and payable through accounts.
2. As applicable, determine whether the bank has established policies, procedures, and
processes to respond to specific special measures imposed by FinCEN that are applicable
to its operations.  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes fordetecting accounts or transactions with jurisdictions, financial institutions, or transactions
subject to final special measures.
3. Determine, through discussions with management and review of the bank’ s
documentation, whether the bank has taken action in response to final special measures.
Transaction Testing  
4.D etermine all final special measures issued by FinCEN under section 311 that are
applicable to the bank ( refer to the FinCEN Web site ).
5.F or any of the first four types of special measures, determine whether the bank obtained,
recorded, or reported the information required by each particular special measure.
6. For the fifth special measure (prohibition), determine whether the bank complied with the
prohibitions or restrictions required by each particular special measure, and compliedwith any other actions required by the special m easures.
7.As necessary, search the bank ’s MIS and other appropriate records for accounts or
transactions with jurisdictions, financial institutions, or transactions subject to finalspecial measures.
8. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the ability of policies, procedures, and processes to meet regulatoryrequirements associated with special measures.

Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Reporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  137 2/27/2015.V2  Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts 
Reporting — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the 
reporting of foreign bank and financial accounts. 
Each person142 (including a bank) subject to U.S. jurisdiction with a financial interest in, or 
signature or other authority over, a bank, a securities, or any other financial account in a 
foreign country must electronically file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts 
(FBAR) through the BSA E- Filing System if the aggregate value of these financial accounts 
exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year .143 The term “financial account” 
generally includes, among other things, accounts in which assets are held in a commingled 
fund and the account owner holds an equity interest in the fund, (e.g., a mutual fund) , as well 
as debit card and prepaid card accounts . A bank must file an FBAR on its own accounts that 
meet this definition; additionally, the bank may be obligated to file these forms for customer accounts in which the bank has a financial interest or over which it has signature or other 
authority. 
An FBAR must be filed on or before June 30 of each calendar year for foreign financial 
accoun ts where the aggregate value exceeded  $10,000 at any time during the previous 
calendar year.  
FinCEN issued a final rule that became effective March 28, 2011 regarding reports of foreign financial accounts  .
144 Subsequently, FinCEN announced further extensions of time for 
certain FBAR filings in light of ongoing questions regarding the filing requirement and its  
application to individuals with signature authority over but no financial interest in certain types 
of accounts. On February 14, 2012, FinCEN issued Notice 2012-1 to extend the filing date for certain individuals with signature authority over but no financial interest in one or more foreign 
financial accounts. 
The FBAR filing  deadline for U.S. persons with only signature authority 
over (but not financia l interest in) a foreign financial accou nt was extended to June 30, 2015. 
142 As defined in 31 CFR 1010.100 (mm), the term “person” means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a 
trust or estate, a joint stock company, an association, a syndicate, joint venture or other unincorporated 
organization or group, an Indian Tribe (a s that term is defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act), and all 
entities cognizable as legal personalities.   
IRS guidance further states that the term “United States person” includes U.S. citizens; U.S. residents; entities, including but not limited to, corporations, partnerships, or limited liability companies, created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States; and trusts or estates formed under the laws of the United States. Refer to the IRS FBAR Reference Guid e.  See also

International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments R eporting — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  139 2/27/2015.V2  International Transportation of Currency or Monetary 
Instruments Reporting — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the ba nk’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the 
reporting of international shipments of currency or monetary instruments. 
Each person145 (including a bank) who physically transports, mails, or ships currency or 
monetary instruments in exce ss of $10,000 at one time out of or into the United States (and 
each person who causes such transportation, mailing, or shipment) must file a Report of 
International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR).146 A CMIR must 
be filed with the appropriate Bureau of Customs and Border Protection officer or with the 
commissioner of Customs at the time of entry into or departure from the United States .  
When a person receives currency or monetary instruments in an amount exceeding $10,000 at one ti me that have been shipped from any place outside the United States, a CMIR must be 
filed with the appropriate Bureau of Customs and Border Protection officer or with the commissioner of Customs within 15 days of receipt of the instruments (unless a report has already been filed) .  The report is to be completed by or on behalf of the person requesting 
transfer of the currency or monetary instruments .  However, banks are not required to report 
these items on a CMIR if they are mailed or shipped through the postal  service or by 
common carrier .
147 In addition, a commercial bank or trust company organized under the 
laws of any state or of the United States is not required to report overland shipments of currency or monetary instruments if they are shipped to or received from an established customer maintaining a deposit relationship with the bank and if the bank reasonably concludes the amounts do not exceed what is commensurate with the customary conduct of 
the business, industry, or profession of the customer concerned. 
Regardless  of whether an exemption from filing a CMIR applies, banks are not relieved of 
other monitoring and reporting obligations under the BSA.  Banks must report the receipt or 
disbursement of currency in excess of $10,000 on a Currency Trans action Report (CTR) 
subject to the exemptions at 31 CFR 1020.315.  Banks must also monitor for and report 
suspicious activity. 
145 As defined in 31 CFR 1010.100 (mm), the term “person” means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a 
trust or estate, a joint stock company, an association, a syndicate, joint venture or other unincorporated 
organization or group, a n Indian Tribe (as that term is defined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act), and all 
entities cognizable as legal personalities.  
146 The obligation to file the CMIR is solely on the person who transports, mails, ships or receives, or causes or 
attempts to transport, mail, ship, or receive.  No other person is under any obligation to file a CMIR.  Thus, if a 
customer walks into the bank and declares that he or she has received or transported currency in an aggregate 
amount exceeding $10,000 from a place outsi de the United States and wishes to deposit the currency into his or 
her account, the bank is under no obligation to file a CMIR on the customer’s behalf (see FIN-1998- R002 
formerly known as Treasury Administrative Ruling 88 -2).  Also refer to CMIR guidance for common carriers of 
currency, including armored car services , FIN -2014- G002, August 1, 2014.  
147 In contrast, a bank is required to file a CMIR to report shipments of currency or monetary instruments to 
foreign offices when those shipments are performed directly by bank personnel, such as currency shipments handled by bank employees using bank -owned vehicles.

of business.  If not, a SAR  should be considered.

International Transportation of Currency or 
Monetary Instruments Reporting  
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the 
reporting of international shipments of currency or monetary instruments. 
1. Determine whether the bank has (or has caused to be) physically transported, mailed, or
shipped currency or other monetary instruments in excess of $10,000, at one time, out of
the United States, or whether the bank has received currency or other monetaryinstruments in excess of $10,000, at one time, that has been physically transported ,
mailed, or shipped into the United States.
2. If applicable, review the bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for filing a Report of
International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR)  for eachshipment of currency or other monetary instruments in excess of $10,000 out of or intothe United States (except for shipments sent through the postal service, common carrier,
or to which another exception from CMIR reporting applies).
Transaction Testing  
3. On the basis of a risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the bank’ s
a
udit findings, select a sample of transactions conducted after  the previous examination
to determine whether the bank has appropriately completed, submitted, and retainedcopies of the CMIRs .
4. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the ability of policies, procedures, and processes to meet regulatoryrequirements associated with CMIRs.
5. On the basis of the previous conclusion and the risks associated with the bank’ s activity
in this area, proceed to expanded examination procedures, if necessary.

Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  142 2/27/2015.V2  Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s risk -based Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) 
compliance program to evaluate whether it is appropriate for the bank’s OFAC risk, taking 
into consideration its products, services, customers, entities, transactions, and geographic 
locations. 
OFAC is an office of the U.S. Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade 
sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted individuals and entities such as foreign countries, regimes, terrorists, international narcotics 
traffickers, and those engaged in certain activities such as  the proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction  or transnational organized crime. 
OFAC acts under Presidential wartime and national emergency powers, as well as various 
authorit ies granted by specific legislation, to impose controls on transactions and to freeze 
assets under U.S. jurisdiction.  OFAC has been delegated responsibility by the Secretary of the Treasury for developing, promulgating, and administering U.S. sanctions progr ams.
148  
Many of the se sanctions are based on United Nations and other international mandates; 
therefore, they are multilateral in scope, and involve close cooperation with allied governments.  Other sanctions are specific to the national security interests of the United 
States .   
On November 9, 2009, OFAC issued a final rule entitled “Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines ” in order to provide guidance to persons subject to its regulations.  The document 
explains the procedures that OFAC follows in determ ining the appropriate enforcement 
response to apparent violations of its regulations.  Some enforcement responses may result in the issuance of a civil penalty that, depending on the sanctions program affected, may be as much as $250,000 per violation or t wice the amount of a transaction, whichever is greater .  
The Guidelines outline the various factors that OFAC takes into account when making enforcement determinations, including the adequacy of a compliance program in place within 
an institution to ensure compliance with OFAC regulations.
149  
All U.S. persons,150 including U.S. banks, bank holding companies, and nonbank 
subsidiaries, must comply with OFAC ’s regulations.151 The federal banking agencies

Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  143 2/27/2015.V2  evaluate OFAC compliance programs  to ensure that all banks subject to their supervision 
comply with the sanctions.152 Unlike the BSA, the laws and OFAC-issued regulations apply 
not only to U.S. banks, their domestic branches, agencies, and international banking 
facilities, but also to their  foreign branches, and often overseas offices and subsidiaries.  
OFAC encourages banks to take a risk-based approach to designing and implementing an OFAC compliance program.  In general, the regulations that OFAC administers require 
banks to do the following: 
•Block accounts and other property of specified countries, entities, and individuals.
•Prohibit or reject unlicensed trade and financial transactions with specified countries,
entities, and individuals.
Blocked Transactions 
U.S. law requires that assets  and accounts of an OFAC-specified country, entity, or 
individual be blocked when such property is located in the United States, is held by U.S. individuals or entities, or comes into the possession or control of U.S. individuals or entities.  For example,  if a funds transfer comes from offshore and is being routed through a U.S. bank 
to an offshore bank, and there is an OFAC -designated party to the transaction, it must be 
blocked.  The definition of assets and property is broad and is specifically defined within each sanction program .  Assets and property includes anything of direct, indirect, present, 
future, or contingent value (including all types of bank transactions).  Banks must block 
transactions that: 
•Are by or on behalf of a blocked individual or entity ;
•Are to or go through a blocked entity ; or
•Are in connection with a transaction in which a blocked individual or entity has an
interest.
For example, if a U.S. bank receives instructions to make a funds transfer payment that falls into one of these categories, it must execute the payment order and place the funds into a blocked account.
153 A payment order cannot be canceled or amended after it is received by a 
U.S. bank in the absence of an authorization from OFAC. 
incorporated entities and their foreign branc hes.  In the case of certain programs, such as those regarding Cuba 
and North Korea, foreign subsidiaries owned or controlled by U.S. companies also must comply.  Certain 
programs also require foreign persons in possession of U.S. origin goods to comply.  
151 Additional information is provided in Foreign Assets Control Regulations for the Financial Community, 
which is available on  the OFAC Web site .  
152 31 CFR Chapter V.  
153 A blocked account is a segregated interest -bearing account (at a commercially reasonable rate), which holds 
the customer’s property until the target is delisted, the sanctions program is rescinded, or the customer obtains 
an OFAC license authorizing the release of the property.  
--- Page 149 ---
Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  144 2/27/2015.V2  Prohibited Transactions  
In some cases , an underlying transaction may be prohibited, but there is no blockable interest 
in the transaction (i.e., the transaction should not be accepted, but there is no OFAC 
requirement to block the assets).  In these cases, the transaction is simply rejected, (i.e., not 
processed ).  For example, the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations prohibit transactions in 
support of commercial activities in Sudan.  Therefore, a U.S. bank would have to reject a funds transfer between two companies, which are not Specially Designated Nationals or 
Blocked Persons (SDN), involving an export to a company in Sudan that also is not an SDN.  Because the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations would only require blocking transactions with 
the Government of Sudan or an SDN, there would be no blockable interest in the funds 
between the two companies .  However, because the transactions would constitute the 
exportation of services to Sudan, which is prohibited, the U.S. bank cannot process the 
transaction and would simply reject the transaction. 
It is important to note that the OFAC regime specifying prohibitions against certain 
countries, entities, and individuals is separate and distinct from the provision within the BSA ’s CIP regulation (31 CFR 1020.220(a)(4)) that requires banks to compare ne w accounts 
against government lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations within a reasonable period of time after the account is opened.  OFAC lists have not been designated government lists for purposes of the CIP rule.  Refer to the core overview section , “Customer 
Identification Program,” page 47, for further guidance .  However, OFAC ’s requirements 
stem from other statutes not limited to terrorism, and OFAC sanctions apply to transactions, 
in addition to account relationships. 
OFAC Licenses 
OFAC has the authority, through a licensing process, to permit certain transactions that 
would otherwise be prohibited under its regulations.  OFAC can issue a license to engage in an otherwise prohibited transaction when it determines that the transaction does not undermine the U.S. policy objectives of the particular sanctions program, or is otherwise justified by U.S. national security or foreign policy objectives.  OFAC can also promulgate general licenses, which authorize categories of transactions, such as allowing reasonable service charges on blocked accounts, without the need for case- by-case authorization from 
OFAC .  These licenses can be found in the regulations for each sanctions program (31 CFR, 
Chapter V (Regulations)) and may be acce ssed from the OFAC Web site.  Before processing 
transactions that may be covered under a general license, banks should verify that such 
transactions meet the relevant criteria of the general license.
154 
Specific licenses are issued on a case- by-case basis .155 A specific license is a written 
document issued by OFAC authorizing a particular transaction or set of transactions 
generally limited to a specified time period .  To receive a specific license, the person or 
154 License  information for a particular sanction program is available on  the OFAC Web site  or by contacting 
OFAC’s Licensing area at (202) 622-2480.  
155 Application s for a specific license may be submitted either online from  the OFAC Web site , or in writing 
to: Licensing Division, Office of Foreign Assets Control, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 
20220.  
--- Page 150 ---
Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  145 2/27/2015.V2  entity who would like to undertake the transaction must submit an application to OFAC.  If 
the transaction conforms to OFAC’s internal licensing policies and U.S. foreign policy 
objectives, the license generally is issued .  If a bank ’s customer claims to have a specific 
license, the bank should verify that the transaction conforms to the terms and conditions of 
the license (including the effective dates of the license), and may wish to obtain and retain a 
copy of the authorizing license for recordkeeping purposes. 
OFAC Reporting 
Banks must report all blockings to OFAC within 10 business days of the occurrence and annually by September 30 concerning those assets blocked (as of June 30).
156 Once assets or 
funds are blocked, they should be placed in a separate blocked account .  Prohibited 
transactions that are rejected must also be reported to OFAC within  10 business days of the 
occurrence.157 
Banks must keep a full and accurate record of each rejected transaction for at least five years after the date of the transaction .  For blocked property (including blocked transactions), 
records must be maintained for the period the property is blocked and for five years after the 
date the property is unblocked. 
Additional information concerning OFAC regulations, such as Sanctions Program and 
Country Summaries brochures; the SDN and other lists, including both entities and individuals; recent OFAC actions; and “Frequently Asked Questions,” can be found on the 
OFAC Web site.
158 
OFAC Compliance Program  
While not required by specific regulation, but as a matter of sound banking practice and in order to mitigate the risk of noncompliance with OFAC requirements , banks should establish 
and maintain an effective, written OFAC compliance program that is commen surate with 
their OFAC risk profile (based on products, services, customers, and geographic locations).  The program should identify higher-risk areas, provide for appropriate internal controls for screening and reporting, establish independent testing for compliance, designate a bank 
employee or employees as responsible for OFAC compliance, and create training programs 
for appropriate personnel in all relevant areas of the bank .   
OFAC Risk Assessment  
A fundamental element of a sound OFAC compliance program is the bank’ s assessment of its 
specific product lines, customer base, and nature of transactions and identification of high er-
risk areas for potential OFAC sanctions risk.  The initial identification of higher-risk 
customers for purposes of OFAC m ay be performed as part of the bank ’s CIP and CDD 
procedures.  As OFAC sanctions can reach into virtually all areas of its operations, banks 
should consider all types of transactions, products, and services when conducting their risk

Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  146 2/27/2015.V2  assessment and establi shing appropriate policies, procedures, and processes .  An effective 
risk assessment should be a composite of multiple factors (as described in more detail 
below), and depending upon the circumstances, certain factors may be weighed more heavily 
than other s. 
Another consideration for the risk assessment is account and transaction parties.  New 
accounts should be compared with OFAC lists prior to being opened or shortly thereafter.  However, the extent to which the bank includes account parties other than accountholders (e.g., beneficiaries, guarantors, principals, beneficial owners, nominee shareholders, directors, signatories, and powers of attorney) in the initial OFAC review during the account opening process, and during subsequent database reviews of existing accounts, depends on 
the bank’s risk profile and available technology. 
Based on the bank’ s OFAC risk profile for each area and available technology, the bank 
should establish policies, procedures, and processes for reviewing transactions and 
transact ion parties (e.g., issuing bank, payee, endorser, or jurisdiction).  Currently, OFAC 
provides guidance on transactions parties on checks.  The guidance states if a bank knows or has reason to know that a transaction party on a check is an OFAC target, the bank’ s 
processing of the transaction would expose the bank to liability, especially personally handled transactions in a higher- risk area.  For example, if a bank knows or has a reason to 
know that a check transaction involves an OFAC-prohibited party or country, OFAC would 
expect timely identification and appropriate action.  
In evaluating the level of risk, a bank should exercise judgment and take into account all 
indicators of risk.  Although not an exhaustive list, examples of products, services, 
custome rs, and geographic locations that may carry a higher level of OFAC risk include:  
•International funds transfers.
•Nonresident alien accounts.
•Foreign customer accounts.
•Cross -border ACH transactions.
•Commercial letters of credit and other trade finance products .
•Transactional electronic banking.
•Foreign correspondent bank accounts.
•Payable through accounts.
•Concentration accounts.
•International private banking.
•Overseas branches or subsidiaries.
Appendix M (“Quantity of Risk — OFAC Procedures ”) provides guidance to examiners on 
assessing OFAC risks facing a bank .  The risk assessment can be used to assist the examiner 
--- Page 152 ---
Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  147 2/27/2015.V2  in determining the scope of the OFAC examination.  Additional information on compliance 
risk is posted by OFAC on its Web site under “ Frequ ently Asked  Questions.”159  
Once the bank has identified its areas with higher OFAC risk, it should develop appropriate 
policies, procedures, and processes to address the associated risks.  Banks may tailor these 
policies, procedures, and processes to the specific nature of a business line or product.  Furthermore, banks are encouraged to periodically reassess their OFAC risks.  
Internal Controls  
An effective OFAC compliance program should include internal controls for identifying 
suspect accounts and transact ions, as well as reporting blocked and rejected transactions to 
OFAC .  Internal controls should include the following elements: 
Identifying and review ing suspect transactions .  The bank’s policies, procedures, and 
processes should address how the bank identif ies and review s transactions and accounts for 
possible OFAC violations, whether conducted manually, through interdiction software, or a 
combination of both.  For screening purposes, the bank should clearly define its criteria for comparing names pro vided on the OFAC list with the names in the bank’s files or on 
transactions and for identifying transactions or accounts involving sanctioned countries.  The 
bank’s policies, procedures, and processes should also address how the bank  determine s 
whether an  initial OFAC hit is a valid match or a false hit.
160 A high volume of false hits may 
indicate a need to review the bank’s interdiction program. 
The screening criteria used by banks to identify name variations and misspellings should be 
based on the level of OFAC risk associated with the particular product or type of transaction.  For example, in a higher- risk area with a high -volume of transactions, the bank’ s interdiction 
software should be able to identify  close name derivations for review .  The SDN list attempts 
to provide name derivations; however, the l ist may not include all derivations .  More 
sophisticated interdiction software may be able to catch variations of an SDN’s name not included on the SDN list.  Banks with lower OFAC risk and those with low volumes of transactions may decide to manually filter for OFAC compliance .  Decisions to use 
interdiction software and the degree of sensitivity of that software should be based on a bank’s assessment of its risk and the volume of its transactions.  In determining the frequency of OFAC checks and the filtering criteria used (e.g., name derivations), banks should consider the likelihood of incurring a violation and available technology.  In addition, banks should periodically reassess their OFAC filtering s ystem .  For example, if a bank identifies a 
name derivation of an OFAC target, then OFAC suggests that the bank add the name to its 
filtering process.  
New accounts should be compared with the OFAC lists prior to being opened or shortly 
thereafter (e.g., du ring nightly processing).  B anks that perform OFAC checks after account

Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  148 2/27/2015.V2  to completing an OFAC check may be subject to possible enforcement action .  In addition, 
banks should have policies, procedures, and processes in place to check existing customers 
when there are additions or changes to the OFAC list.  The frequency of the review should be based on the bank’ s OFAC risk .  For example, banks with a lower  OFAC risk level may 
periodically (e.g., weekly, monthly or quarterly) ) compare the customer base against the 
OFAC list .  Transactions such as funds transfers, letters of credit, and noncustomer 
transactions should be checked against OFAC lists prior to being executed.  When developing OFAC policies, procedures, and processes, the bank should keep in mind that OFAC considers the continued operation of an account or the processing of transactions post-designation, along with the adequacy of the bank’s OFAC compliance program, to be a factor in determining the appropriate enforcement response to an apparent violation of OFAC 
regulations.
161 The bank should maintain documentation of its OFAC checks on new 
accounts, the existing customer base and specific transactions.  
If a bank uses a third party, such as an agent or service provider, to perform OFAC checks on its behalf, as with any other responsibility performed by a third party , the bank is ultimately 
responsible for that third party’s compliance with the OFAC requirements.  As a result, banks should have a written agreement in place and establish adequate controls and review 
procedures for such relationships. 
Updating OFAC list s.  A bank’ s OFAC compliance program should include policies, 
procedures, and processes for timely updating of the lists of sanctioned  countries  and blocked 
entities, and individuals, and disseminating such information throughout the bank’ s domestic 
operat ions and its offshore offices, branches and, in the case of Iran and Cuba, foreign 
subsidiaries.  This would include ensuring that any manual updates of interdiction software 
are completed in a timely manner.  
Screening Automated Clearing House (ACH)  transactions.  ACH transaction s may 
involve persons or parties subject to the sanctions programs administered by OFAC .  Refer to 
the expanded overview section, “Automated Clearing House Transactions, ” page  216, for 
additional guidance.  OFAC has clarified  its interpretation of the application of OFAC’s rules 
for domestic and cross-border ACH transactions and provided more detailed guidance on international ACH transactions.
162 
With respect to domestic ACH transactions, the Originating Depository Financial Institution 
(ODFI) is responsible for verifying that the Originator is not a blocked party and making a good faith effort to ascertain  that the Originator is not transmitting b locked funds .  The 
Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI) similarly is responsible for verifying that the Receiver is not a blocked party.  In this way, the ODFI and the RDFI are relying on each 
other for compliance with OFAC regulations. 
If an ODFI receives  domestic ACH transactions that its customer has already batched, the 
ODFI is not responsible for unbatching those transactions to ensure that no transactions 
161 Refer to 74 Fed. Reg. 57593 (November 9, 2009), Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines .  Further 
information is available on the OFAC Web site .

transactions .

Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  149 2/27/2015.V2  violate OFAC’s regulations .  If an ODFI unbatches a file originally received from the 
Originator in order to process “on-us” transactions, that ODFI is responsible for the OFAC 
compliance for the on -us transactions because it is acting as both the ODFI and the RDFI for 
those transactions.  ODFIs acting in this capacity should already know their customers for the purposes of OFAC and other regulatory requirements.  For the residual unbatched transactions in the file that are not “on-us,” as well as those situations where banks deal with 
unbatched ACH records for reasons other than to strip out the on-us transactions, banks should determine the level of their OFAC risk and develop appropriate policies, procedures, and processes to address the associated risks .  Such policies might involve screening each 
unbatched ACH record .  Similarly, banks  that have relationships with third -party service 
providers should assess those relationships and their related ACH transactions to ascertain the bank’s level of OFAC risk and to develop appropriate policies, procedures, and processes 
to mitigate that risk . 
With respect to cross -border screening, similar but somewhat more stringent OFAC 
obligations hold for International ACH transactions  (IAT ).  In the case of inbound IATs, and 
regardless of whether the OFAC flag in the IAT is set , an RDFI is responsible for compliance 
with OFAC sanctions programs.  For outbound IATs , however, the ODFI cannot rely on 
OFAC screening by an RDFI outside of the United States .  In these situations, the ODFI must 
exercise increased diligence to ensure that illegal transactions are not processed.  
Due diligence for an inbound or outbound IAT may include screening the parties to a 
transaction, as well as reviewing the details of the payment field information for an indication of a sanctions violation, investigat ing the resulting hits, if any, and ultimately 
blocking or rejecting the transaction, as appropriate.  Refer to the expanded overview section, 
“Automated Clearing House Transactions,” page 216, for additional guidance. 
Additional information on the types o f retail payment systems (ACH payment systems) is 
available in the FFIEC  Information Technology Examination Handbook .
163 
In guidance issued on March 10, 2009, OFAC authorized institutions in the United States 
when they are acting as an ODFI/Gateway Operator (GO) for inbound IAT debits to reject 
transactions that appear to involve blockable property or property interests.164 The guidance 
further state s that to the extent that an ODFI/GO screens inbound IAT debits for possible 
OFAC violations prior to execution and in the course of such screening discovers a potential OFAC violation, the suspect transaction is to be removed from the batch for further investigation .  If the ODFI/GO determines that the transaction does appear to violate OFAC 
regulations, the ODFI/GO should refuse to process the transfer .  The procedure applies to 
transactions that would normally be blocked as well as to transactions that would normally be 
rejected for OFAC purposes based on the information in the payment. 
Reporting .  An OFAC compliance program should also include policies, procedures, and 
processes for handling validly  blocked or rejected items under the various sanctions

Office of Foreign Assets Control — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  150 2/27/2015.V2  programs.  When there is a question about the validity of an interdiction, banks can contact 
OFAC by phone or e-hot line for guidance .  Most other items should be reported through 
usual channels within ten days of the occurrence.  The policies, procedures, and processes should also address the management of blocked accounts.  Banks are responsible for tracking the amount of blocked funds, the ownership of those funds, and interest paid on those funds.  Total amounts blocked, including interest, must be reported to OFAC by September 30 of each year (information as of June 30).  When a bank acquires or merges with another bank, both banks should take into consideration the need to review and maintain such records and 
information. 
Banks no longer need to file SAR s based solely on blocked narcotics- or terrorism -related 
transactions, as long as the bank files the required blocking report with OFAC.  However, 
because blocking reports require only limited information, if the bank is in possession of additional information not included on the OFAC blocking report, a separate SAR  should be 
filed with FinCEN that would include such information.  In addition, the bank should file a 
SAR if the transaction itself would be considered suspicious in the absence of a valid OFAC 
match.
165 
Maintaining license information.  OFAC recommends that banks consider maintaining 
copies of customers’ OFAC licenses on file .  This allow s the bank to verify whether a 
customer is initiating a legal transaction .  Banks should also be aware of the expiration date 
on the OFAC license.  If it is unclear whether a particular transaction would be  authorized 
under the terms of the license, the bank should contact OFAC .  Maintaining copies of OFAC 
licenses also is useful when  another bank in the payment chain requests verification of a 
license’ s validity .  Copies of OFAC licenses should be maintained for five years, following 
the most recent transaction conducted in accordance with the license.  
Independent Testing 
Every bank should conduct an independent test of its OFAC compliance program that is 
performed by the internal audit department, outside auditors, consultants, or other qualified independent parties.  For large banks, the frequency and area of the independent test should be based on the known or perceived risk of specific business areas.  For smaller banks, the audit should be consistent with the bank’s OFAC risk profile or be based on a perceived risk.  The person(s) responsible for testing should conduct an objective, comprehensive evaluation of OFAC policies, procedures, and processes.  The audit scope should be comprehensive enough to assess OFAC compliance risks and evaluate the adequacy of the OFAC 
compliance program.  
Responsible Individual  
It is recommended that every bank designate a qualified individual(s) to be responsible for 
the day- to-day compliance of the OFAC compliance program, including changes or updates 
to the various sanctions programs, and the reporting of blocked or rejected transactions to OFAC and the oversight of blocked funds.  This individual should have an appropriate level 
of knowledge about OFAC regulations commensurate with the bank’ s OFAC risk profile.  
165 Refer to FinCEN Release Number 2004 -02, Unitary Filing of Suspicious Activity and Blocking Reports , 69 
Fed. Reg.  76847 (December 23, 2004).

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  151 2/27/2015.V2  Training 
The bank should provide adequate training for all appropriate employ ees on its OFAC 
compliance program, procedures and processes.  The scope and frequency of the training 
should be consistent with the bank’s OFAC risk profile and appropriate to employee 
responsibilities .

Office of Foreign Assets Control — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  152 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Office of Foreign Assets Control  
Objective.  Assess the bank ’s risk -based Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) 
compliance program to evaluate whether it is appropriate for the bank’s OFAC risk, taking 
into consideration its products, services, customers, entities, transactions, and geographic 
locations . 
1. Determine whether the board of directors and senior management of the bank have
developed policies, procedures, and processes based on their risk assessment to ensurecompliance with OFAC laws and regulations.
2.Review  the bank’ s OFAC compliance program  in the context of the bank’s OFAC risk
assessment .  Consider the following:
•The extent of, and method for, conducting OFAC searches of each relevant
department  or business line (e.g., ACH transactions, cross -border funds transfers,
trade fi nance products, monetary instrument sales, check cashing, trusts, loans,
deposits, and investments) as the process may vary from one department or business
line to another.
•The ex tent of, and method for, conducting OFAC searches of account parties other
than accountholders, which may include beneficiaries, guarantors, principals,
beneficial owners, nominee shareholders, directors, signatories, and powers of
attorney.
•The assignment of responsibilities within the institution  for ensuring compliance with
OFAC.
•Timeliness of obtaining and updating OFAC lists and  filtering criteria.
•The appropriateness of the filtering criteria used by the bank to reasonably identify
OFAC matches (e.g.,  the extent to which the filtering  or search criteria includes
misspellings and name derivations).
•The process used to investigate potential matches, including escalation procedures for
potential matches.
•The process used to block and reject transactions.
•The process used to inform management of blocked or rejected transactions.
•The adequacy and timeliness of filing  to OFAC.
•The process to manage blocked accounts (such accounts must be reported to OFACand earn  a commercially reasonable rate of interest  while the funds remain blocked).
•The record -retention requirements ( e.g., five -year requirement to retain relevant
OFAC records; for blocked property, record retention for as long as blocked; once
unblocked, records must be maintained for five years).

4.R
eview the adequacy of the bank ’s OFAC training program based on the bank’ s OFAC
risk assessment.
5.Determine whether the bank has adequately addressed weaknesses or deficiencies
identified by OFAC, auditors, or regulators.
Transaction Testing  
6. On the basis of a bank’s risk assessment, prior examination reports, and a review of the
ba
nk’s audit findings, select the following samples to test the bank ’s OFAC compliance
program for adequacy, as follows:
•Sample new accounts (e.g., deposit, loan, trust, safe deposit, investments, credit cards,
and foreign office accounts,) and evaluate the filtering process used to search theOFAC database (e.g., the timing of the search), and documentation maintained
evidencing the searches.
•Sample appropriate transactions that may not be related to an account (e.g., funds
transfers, monetary instrument sales , and check -cashing transactions), and evaluate
the filtering criteria used to search the OFAC database, the timing of the search, and
documentation maintained evidencing the searches.
•If the bank uses an automated system to conduct searches, assess the timing of when
updates are made to the system, and when the most recent OFAC changes were madeto the system.  Also, evaluate whether all of the bank’ s databases are run against the
automated system, and the frequency upon which searches are made.  If there is any
doubt regarding the effectiveness of the OFAC filter, then run tests of the sys tem by
entering test account names that are the same as or similar to those recently added to
the OFAC list to determine whether the system successfully identifies a potential hit.
•If the bank does not use an automated system, evaluate the process used to check the
existing customer base against the OFAC list and the frequency of such checks.
•Review a sample of potential OFAC matches and evaluate the bank ’s resolution for
blocking and rejecting processes.
•Review a sample of blocked and rejected reports filed to OFAC and evaluate their
completeness and timeliness.
•If the bank is required to maintain blocked accounts, select a sample and ensure that
the bank maintains adequate records of amounts blocked and the ownership of
blocked funds, pays a commercially reasonable rate of interest on all blocked
accounts, and  accurately report s required information on blocked property annually
(by September 30) to OFAC.  Test the controls in place to verify that the account isblocked.
•P
ull a sample of false hits (potent ial matches) to check their handling; the resolution
of a false hit should take place outside of the business line.

ma
nagement, advise bank management to immediately notify  OFAC of unreported
transactions, and immediately notify supervisory personnel at your regulatory agency.
8.Determine the origin of deficiencies (e.g., training, audit, risk assessment, internal
controls, management oversight), and conclude on the adequac y of the bank ’s OFAC
compliance program.
9. Discuss OFAC related examination findings with bank management.
10. Include OFAC conclusions within the report of examination, as appropriate.

PROCEDURES FOR CONSOLIDATED AND OTH ER 
TYPES OF BSA/AML  COMPLIANCE PROGRAM  
STRUCTURE S 
BSA/AML Compliance Program 
Structures — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the structure and management of the organization’s BSA/AML 
compliance program and if applicable, the organization’s consolidated or partially 
consolidated approach to BSA/AML compliance.  
Every bank must have a comprehensive BSA/AML compliance program that addresses BSA 
requirements applicab le to all operations of the organization.166 Banking organizations have 
discretion as to how the BSA/AML compliance program is structured and managed.  A banking organization may structure and manage the BSA/AML compliance program or some parts of the progra m within a legal entity; with some degree of consolidation across entities 
within an organization; or as part of a comprehensive enterprise risk management 
framework.  
Many large, complex banking organizations aggregate risk of all types (e.g., compliance, 
operational, credit, interest rate risk, etc.) on a firm- wide basis in order to maximize 
efficiencies and better identify, monitor, and control all types of risks within or across affiliates, subsidiaries, lines of business, or jurisdictions.
167 In such organizations, 
management of BSA risk is generally the responsibility of a corporate compliance function 
that supports and oversees the BSA/AML compliance program . 
Other banking organizations may adopt a structure that is less centralized but still 
consolidate s some or all aspects of BSA/AML compliance.  For example, risk assessment, 
internal controls (e.g., suspicious activity monitoring), independent testing, or training may be managed centrally .  Such centralization can effectively  maximize efficiencies and enhance 
assessment of risks and implementation of controls across business lines, legal entities , and 
jurisdictions of operation.  For instance, a centralized BSA/AML risk assessment function 
may enable a banking organization to determine its overall risk exposure to a customer doing 
166 Neither FinCEN nor banking agency rules impose a specific BSA/AML compliance program obligation on 
Bank Holding Companies, Unitary Savings and Loan Holding Companies, and parents of Industrial Loan 
Companies.  Nevertheless, these entities, as a result of their primary business function (e.g., insurance company 
or broker -dealer), may be subject to a BSA/AML compliance program obligation under Treasury rules or rules 
of other agencies.  
167 For further detail, refer to Compliance Risk Management Programs and Oversight at Large Banking 
Organizations with Complex Compliance Profiles,  Federal Reserve Board  SR Letter 08 -8, October 16, 2008 
(FRB Guidance).  The FRB Guidance generally addresses overall compliance functions within large, complex firms, and endorses for  all firms the principles set forth in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s 
guidance, Compliance and the compliance function in banks
 (April 2005).

BSA/AML Compliance Program Structures — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  156 2/27/2015.V2  business with the organization in multiple business lines or jurisdictions.168 Regardless of 
how a consolidated BSA/AML compliance program is organized, it should reflect the 
organization’s business structure, size, and complexit y, and be designed to effectively 
address risks, exposures, and applicable legal requirements across the organization.  
A consolidated approach should also include the establishment of corporate standards for 
BSA/AML compliance that reflect the expectations  of the organization’s board of directors, 
with senior management working to ensure that the BSA/AML compliance program implements these corporate standards .  Individual lines of business policies would then 
supplement the corporate standards and address s pecific risks within the line of business or 
department.  
A consolidated BSA/AML compliance program typically includes  a central point where 
BSA/AML risks throughout the organization are aggregated.  Refer to “Consolidated 
BSA/AML Compliance Risk Assessmen t,” page 24.  Under a consolidated approach, risk 
should be assessed both within and across all business lines, legal entities , and jurisdictions 
of operation.  Programs for global organizations should incorporate the AML laws and 
requirements of the various jurisdictions in which they operate.  Internal audit should assess 
the level of compliance with the consolidated BSA/AML compliance program.  
Examiners should be aware that some complex, diversified banking organizations may have 
various subsidiaries that hold different types of licenses and banking charters or may organize business activities and BSA/AML compliance program components across their legal entities .  For instance, a highly diversified banking organization may establish or 
maintain accounts  using multiple legal entities that are examined by multiple regulators .  
This action may be taken  in order to maximize efficiencies, enhance tax benefits, adhere to 
jurisdictional regulations, etc .  This methodology may present a challenge to an examiner 
reviewing BSA/AML compliance in a legal entity within an organization.  As appropriate, 
examiners should coordinate efforts with other regulatory agencies in order to address these 
challenges or ensure the examination scope appropriately covers the legal entity examined . 
Structure of the BSA/AML Compliance Function 
As discussed above, a banking organization has discretion as to how to structure and manage 
its BSA/AML compliance program.  For example, a small institution may choose to combine 
BSA/AML compliance with other functions and utilize the same personnel in several roles.  In such circumstances, there should still be adequate senior- level attention to BSA/AML 
compliance, and sufficient dedicated resources .  As is the case in all structu res, the audit 
function should remain independent. 
A larger, more complex firm may establish a corporate BSA/AML compliance function to 
coordinate some or all BSA/AML responsibilities .  For example, w hen there is delegation of 
BSA/AML compliance responsibi lities, and BSA/AML compliance staff is located within 
lines of business, expectations should be clearly set forth in order to ensure effective implementation of the BSA/AML compliance program.  In particular, allocation of

Banks,” page  164, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s guidance Consolidated Know Your 
Customer (KYC) Risk Management . . 
--- Page 162 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program Structures — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  157 2/27/2015.V2  responsibility should be clear with respect to the content and comprehensiveness of MIS 
reports, the depth and frequency of monitoring efforts, and the role of different parties within the banking organization (e.g., risk, business lines, operations)  in BSA/AML compliance 
decision -making  processes .  Clearly communicating which functions have been delegated 
and which remain centralized helps to ensure consistent implementation of the BSA/AML compliance program among lines of business, affiliates, and jurisdictions.  In addition, a clear line of responsibility may help to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure that objectivity is 
maintained.  
Regardless of the management structure or size of the institution, BSA/AML compliance 
staff located within lines of business is not precluded from close interaction with the management and staff of the various business lines.  BSA/AML compliance functions are often most effective when strong working relationships exist between compliance and 
business line staff. 
In some compliance structures, the complian ce staff reports to the management of the 
business line .  This can occur in smaller institutions when the BSA/AML compliance staff 
reports to a senior bank officer; in larger institutions when the compliance staff reports to a 
line of business manager; or in a foreign banking organization’s  U.S. operations when the 
staff reports to a single office or executive.  These situations can present risks of potential 
conflicts of interest that could hinder effective BSA/AML compliance .  To ensure the 
strength of compliance controls, an appropriate level of BSA/AML compliance independence 
should be maintained, for example, by: 
•Providing BSA/AML compliance staff a reporting line to the corporate compliance or
other independent function;
•Ensuring that BSA/AML compliance staff  is actively involved in  all matters affec ting
AML risk (e.g., new products, review or termination of customer relationships, filing
determinations) ;
•Establishing a process for escalating and objectively resolving disputes between
BSA/AML complia nce staff and business line management ; and
•Establishing internal controls to ensure that compliance objectivity is maintained whenBSA/AML compliance staff is assigned additional bank responsibilities.
Management and Oversight of the BSA/AML Compliance P rogram 
The board of directors and senior management of a bank have different responsibilities and roles in overseeing, and managing BSA/AML compliance risk.  The board of directors has primary responsibility for ensuring that the bank has a comprehensive a nd effective 
BSA/AML compliance program and oversight framework that is reasonably designed to ensure compliance with BSA/AML regulation .  Senior management is responsible for 
implementing the board -approved BSA/AML compliance program. 
--- Page 163 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program Structures — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  158 2/27/2015.V2  Boards of directors.169 The board of directors is responsible for approving the BSA/AML 
compliance program and for overseeing the structure and management of the bank’s 
BSA/AML compliance function.  The board is responsible for setting an appropriate culture of BSA/AML complian ce, establishing clear policies regarding the management of key 
BSA/AML risks, and ensuring that these policies are adhered to in practice.  
The board should ensure that senior management is fully capable, qualified, and properly 
motivated to manage the BSA/AML compliance risks arising from the organization’s business activities in a manner that is consistent with the board’s expectations .  The board 
should ensure that the BSA/AML compliance function has an appropriately prominent status within the organiza tion.  Senior management within the BSA/AML compliance function and 
senior compliance personnel within the individual business lines should have the appropriate authority, independence, and access to personnel and information within the organization, and a ppropriate resources to conduct their activities effectively .  The board should ensure 
that its views about the importance of BSA/AML compliance are understood and communicated across all levels of the banking organization.  The board also should ensure 
that senior management has established appropriate incentives to integrate BSA/AML compliance objectives into management goals and compensation structure across the organization, and that corrective actions, including disciplinary measures, if appropriate, are 
taken when serious BSA/AML compliance failures are identified. 
Senior management.  Senior management is responsible for communicating and reinforcing 
the BSA/AML compliance culture established by the board , and implement ing and enforc ing 
the board- approved BSA/AML compliance program.  If the banking organization has a 
separate BSA/AML compliance function, senior management of the function should 
establish, support, and oversee the organization’s BSA/AML compliance program.  BSA/AML compliance staff sho uld report to the board, or a committee thereof, on the 
effectiveness of the BSA/AML compliance program and significant BSA/AML compliance 
matters.  
Senior management of a foreign banking organization’s U.S. operations should provide 
sufficient information relating to the U.S. operations’ BSA/AML compliance to the 
governance or control functions in its home country, and should ensure that responsible senior management in the home country has an appropriate understanding of the BSA/AML risk and control environment governing U.S. operations.  U.S. management should assess the effectiveness of established BSA/AML control mechanisms for U.S. operations on an ongoing basis and report and escalate areas of concern as needed .  As appropriate, corrective 
action then should be developed , implemented  and validated . 
Consolidated BSA/AML Compliance Programs  
Banking organizations that centrally manage the operations and functions of their subsidiary banks, other subsidiaries, and business lines should ensure that comprehensive risk management policies, procedures, and processes are in place across the organization to 
169 Foreign banking organizations should ensure that, with respect to their U.S. operations, the responsibilities of 
the board described in this section are fulfilled in an appropriate manner through their oversight structur e and 
BSA/AML risk management framework.

BSA/AML Compliance Program Structures — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  159 2/27/2015.V2  address the entire organization’s spectrum of risk.  An adequate consolidated BSA/AML 
compliance program provides the framework for all subsidiaries, business lines, and foreign 
branches to meet their specific regulatory requirements (e.g., country or industry requirements) .  Accordingly, banking organizations that centrally manage a consolidated  
BSA/AML compliance program should, among other things provide appropriate structure; and advise the business lines, subsidiaries, and foreign branches on the development of 
appropriate guidelines .  For additional guidance, refer to the expanded overview section , 
“Foreign Branches and Offices of U.S. Banks, ” page  164. 
An organization applying a consolidated BSA/AML compliance program may choose to manage only specific compliance controls (e.g., suspicious activity monitoring systems, audit) on a consolidated basis, with other compliance controls managed solely within affiliates, subsidiaries, and business lines.  When this approach is taken, examiners must identify which portions of the BSA/AML compliance program are part of the consolidated BSA/AML compliance program .  This information is critical when scoping and planning a 
BSA/AML examination.  
When evaluating a consolidated BSA/AML compliance program for adequacy, the examiner should determine reporting lines and how each affiliate, subsidiary, business line, and jurisdiction fits into the overall compliance structure .  This should include an assessment of 
how clearly roles and responsibilities are communicated across the bank or banking organization.  The examiner also should assess how effectively the bank or banking 
organization monitors BSA/AML compliance throughout the organization, including how well the consolidated and nonconsolidated BSA/AML compliance program captures relevant 
data from subsidiaries. 
The evaluation of a consolidated BSA/AML compliance program should take into 
consideration available information about the adequacy of the individual subsidiaries’ BSA/AML compliance program .  Regardless of the decision to implement a consolidated 
BSA/AML compliance program in whole or in part, the program should ensure that all affiliates, including those operating within foreign jurisdictions, meet their applicable regulatory requirements .  For example, an audit program implemented solely on a 
consolidated basis that does not conduct appropriate transaction testing at all subsidiaries subject to the BSA would not be sufficient to meet regulatory requirements for independent testing for those subsidiaries.  If dissemination of certain information is limited and therefore 
transparency acros s the organization is restricted, audit should be aware and ensure AML 
controls are commensurate with those risks.   
Suspicious Activity Reporting  
Bank holding companies (BHC) or any nonbank subsidiary thereof, or a foreign bank  that is 
subject to the BHC Act or any nonbank subsidiary of such a foreign bank operating in the United States , are required to file SARs .
170   A BHC’s nonbank subsidiaries operating only 
outside the United States are not required to file SARs.  Certain sav ings and loan holding 
companies, and their nondepository subsidiaries, are required to file SARs pursuant to Treasury regulations (e.g., insurance companies (31 CFR 1025.320) and broker/dealers (31 
170 12 CFR 225.4(f).  
--- Page 165 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program Structures — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  160 2/27/2015.V2  CFR 1023.320).  In addition, savings and loan holding companies, if not required, are 
strongly encouraged to file SARs in appropriate circumstances.  On January 20, 2006, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision  issued guidance authorizing banking organizations to share 
SARs with head offices and controlling companies, whether located in the United States or abroad .  Refer to the core overview sec tion, “Suspicious Activity Reporting, ” page  60, for 
additional information .

BSA/AML Compliance Program  Structure s 
Objective.  Assess the structure and management of the banking organization’s BSA/AML 
compliance program, and, if applicable, the banking organization’s consolidated or partially consolidated approach to BSA/AML compliance.  A BSA/AML compliance program may be structured in a variety of ways, and an examiner s hould perform procedures based on the 
structure of the organization.  Completion of these procedures may require communication 
with other regulators. 
1. Review the structure and management of the BSA/AML compliance program.
Communicate with peers at other  federal and state banking agencies, as necessary, to
confirm their understanding of the organization’s BSA/AML compliance program.  This
approach promotes consistent supervision and lessens regulatory burden for the bankingorganization.  Determine the ex tent to which the structure of the  BSA/AML compliance
program affects the organization being examined, by considering:
•The existence of consolidated or partially consolidated operations or functions
responsible for day- to-day BSA/AML operations, including, but not limited to, the
centralization of suspicious activity monitoring and reporting, currency transaction
reporting, currency exemption review and reporting, or recordkeeping activities.
•The consolidation of operational units, such as financial intelli gence units, dedicated
to and responsible for monitoring transactions across activities, business lines, or
legal entities .  (Assess the variety and extent of information that data or transaction
sources (e.g., banks, broker/dealers, trust companies, Edge Act and agreementcorporations, insurance companies, or foreign branches) are entering into the
monitoring and reporting systems ).
•The extent to which the banking organization ( or a corporate-level unit, such as audit
or compliance) performs regular indepe ndent testing of BSA/AML activities.
•The sufficiency of audit in jurisdictions with restrictive privacy laws that may limit
the dissemination of information.
•Whether and to what extent a corporate-level unit sponsors BSA/AML training.
2.Review testing  for BSA/AML compliance throughout the banking organization, as
applicable,  and identify program deficiencies.
3. Review board minutes to determine the adequacy of MIS and of reports provided to the
board of directors.  Ensure that the board of directors has received appropriate
notification of SARs filed.
4. Review policies, procedures, processes, and risk assessments formulated and
implemented by the organization’s board of directors, a board committee thereof, or
senior management .  As part of this revi ew, assess effectiveness of the organization’s
ability to perform the following responsibilities:
--- Page 167 ---
BSA/AML Compliance Program Structures — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  162 2/27/2015.V2  •Manage the BSA/AML compliance program and provide adequate oversight.
•Set and communicate corporate standards that reflect the expectations of the
organization’s board of directors and provide for clear allocation of BSA/AML
compliance responsibilities .
•Promptly identify and effectively measure, monitor, and control key risks throughout
the organization.
•Develop an adequate risk assessment and the policies, procedures, and processes to
comprehensively manage those risks.
•Develop procedures for evaluation, approval, and oversight of risk limits, new
business initiatives, and strategic changes.
•Oversee the compliance of subsidiaries with applicable regulatory requirements (e.g.,
country and industry requirements).
•Oversee the compliance of subsidiaries with the requirements of the BSA/AML
compliance program.
•Identify weaknesses in the BSA/AML compliance program and implement necessary
and timely corrective action, at both the organizational and subsidiary levels.
5.To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements , review the organization’s procedures
for monitoring and filing SARs.171 For additional guidance, refer to the core overview
and examination procedures , “Suspicious Activity Reporting,” page  60 and 76,
respectively.
6. Once the examiner has completed the above procedures, the examiner should discuss
their findings with the following parties, as appropriate:
•Examiner in charge.
•Person (or persons) responsible for ongoing supervision of the organization and
subsidiary banks, as appropriate.
•Corporate management.
171 Bank holding companies (BHC) or any nonbank subsidiary thereof, or a foreign bank that is subject to the 
BHC Act or any nonbank subsidiary of such a foreign bank operating in the United States, are required to file 
SARs (12 CFR 225.4(f)).  A BHC’s nonbank subsidiaries operating only outside the United States are not 
required to file SARs.  Certain savings and loan holding companies, and their nondepository subsidiaries, are 
required to file SARs pursuant to Treasury regulations (e.g., insurance companies (31  CFR  1025.320) and 
broker/dealers (31 CFR 1023.320).  In addition, savings and loan holding companies, if not required, are 
strongly encouraged to file SARs in appropriate circumstances.  On January 20, 2006, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision issued guidance authorizing b anking organizations to share SARs with head offices and controlling companies, whether located 
in the United States or abroad.  Refer to the core overview section, “Suspicious Activity Reporting,” page  60, 
for additional information.

Foreign Branches and Offices of U.S. Banks — Overview 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  164 2/27/2015.V2  Foreign Branches and Offices of U.S. Banks — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the U.S. bank’s systems to manage the risks associated 
with its foreign branches and offices, and management’ s ability to implement effective 
monitoring and reporting systems.  
U.S. banks open foreign branches and offices172 to meet specific customer demands, to help 
the bank grow, or to expand products or services offered.  Foreign branches and offices vary significantly in size, complexity of operations, and scope of products and services offered.  Examiners must ta ke these factors into consideration when reviewing the foreign branches 
and offices AML compliance program.  The definitions of “ financial institution ” and “bank” 
in the BSA and its implementing regulations do not encompass foreign offices or foreign investments of U.S. banks or Edge and agreement corporations.
173 Nevertheless, banks are 
expected to have policies, procedures, and processes in place at all their branches and offices to protect against risks of money laundering and terrorist financing.
174 AML pol icies, 
procedures, and processes at the foreign office or branch should comply with local requirements and be consistent with the U.S. bank’s standards; however, they may need to be 
tailored for local or business practices.
175 
Risk Factors  
Examiners should understand the type of products and services offered at foreign branches 
and offices, as well as the customers and geographic locations served at the foreign branches and offices.  Any service offered by the U.S. bank may be offered by the foreign branches and offices if not prohibited by the host country.  Such products and services offered at the foreign branches and offices may have a different risk profile from that of the same product or service offered in the U.S. bank (e.g., money services businesses are regulated in the United States; however, similar entities in another country may not be regulated).  Therefore, the examiner should be aware that risks associated with foreign branches and offices may 
differ (e.g., wholesale versus retail operations). 
The examiner should understand the foreign jurisdiction’s various AML requirements.  
Secrecy laws or their equivalent may affect the ability of the foreign branch or office to share information with the U.S. parent bank, or the ability of the examiner to e xamine on -site.  
While banking organizations with overseas branches or subsidiaries may find it necessary to tailor monitoring approaches as a result of local privacy laws, the compliance oversight mechanism should ensure it can effectively assess and monitor risks within such branches and subsidiaries.  Although specific BSA requirements are not applicable at foreign branches and offices, banks are expected to have policies, procedures, and processes in place at all 
their branches and offices to protect against risks of money laundering and terrorist 
172 Foreign offices inc lude affiliates and subsidiaries.  
173 Edge and agreement corporations may be used to hold foreign investments (e.g., foreign portfolio 
investments, joint ventures, or subsidiaries).

BSA/AML policies, procedures, and processes.  The foreign branches and offices must 
comply with applicable OFAC requi rements and all local AML -related laws, rules, and 
regulations. 
Risk Mitigation  
Branches and offices of U.S. banks located in higher-risk geographic locations may be vulnerable to abuse by money launderers.  To address this concern, the U.S. bank’ s policie s, 
procedures, and processes for the foreign operation should be consistent with the following 
recommendations: 
•The U.S. bank’s head office and management at the foreign operation should understand
the effectiveness and quality of bank supervision in the host country and understand the
legal and regulatory requirements of the host country.  The U.S. bank’s head officeshould be aware of and understand any concerns that the host country supervisors may
have with respect to the foreign branch or office.
•The U .S. bank’s head office should understand the foreign branches’ or offices ’ risk
profile (e.g., products, services, customers, and geographic locations).
•The U.S. bank’ s head office and management should have access to sufficient
information in order to periodically monitor the activity of their foreign branches and
offices, including the offices’ and branches ’ level of compliance with head office
policies, procedures, and processes.  Some of this may be achieved through MIS  reports.
•The U.S. bank’s head office should develop a system for testing and verifying the
integrity and effectiveness of internal controls at the foreign branches or offices by
conducting in-country audits.  Senior management at the head office should obtain andreview copies, written in  English, of audit reports and any other reports related to AML
and internal control evaluations.
•The U.S. bank’s head office should establish robust information -sharing  practices
between branches and offices, particularly regarding higher-risk account relationships.
The bank should use the information to evaluate and understand account relationships
throughout the corporate structure (e.g., across borders or legal structures).
•The U.S. bank’s head office should be able to provide examiners with any information
deemed necessary to assess compliance with U.S. banking laws.
Foreign branch and office compliance and audit structures can vary substantially based on the scope of operations (e.g., geographic locations) and the type of products, services, and customers .  Foreign branches and offices with multiple locations within a geographic region 
(e.g., Europe, Asia, and South America) are frequently overseen by regional compliance and audit staff .  Regardless of the size or scope of operations, the compliance and audit staff and 
audit programs should be sufficient to oversee the AML risks. 
--- Page 171 ---
Foreign Branches and Offices of U.S. Banks — Overview 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  166 2/27/2015.V2  Scoping AML Examinations  
Examinations may be completed in the host country or in the United States .  The factors that 
to be considered in deciding whether the examination  work should occur in the host 
jurisdiction or the United States include: 
•The risk profile of the foreign branch or office and whether the profile is stable or
changing as a result of a reorganization, the introduction of new products or services, or
other factors, including the risk profile of the jurisdiction itself.
•The effectiveness and quality of bank supervision in the host country.
•Existence of an information- sharing  arrangement  between the host country and the U.S.
supervisor.
•The history of examination or audit concerns at the foreign branch or office.
•The size and complexity of the foreign branch’ s or office ’s operations.
•Effectiveness of internal controls, including systems for managing AML risks on a
consolidated basis and internal audit.
•The cap ability of management at the foreign branch or office to protect the entity from
money laundering or terrorist financing.
•The availability of the foreign branch or office records in the United States.
In some jurisdictions, financial secrecy and other laws may prevent or severely limit U.S. examiners or U.S. head office staff from directly evaluating customer activity or records.  In 
cases when an on-site examination cannot be conducted effectively, examiners should consult with appropriate agency personnel.  In such cases, agency personnel may contact foreign supervisors to make appropriate information sharing or examination arrangements.  In lower -risk situations when information is restricted, examiners may conduct U.S. -based 
examinations ( refer to discussion below).  In higher -risk situations when adequate 
examinations (on-site or otherwise) cannot be effected, the agency may require the head 
office to take action to address the situation, which may include closing the foreign office. 
U.S.-Based Examinations 
U.S.-based, or off- site, examinations generally require greater confidence in the AML 
program at the foreign branch or office, as well as the ability to access sufficient records .  
Such off-site examinations should include discussions with senior bank management at the 
head and foreign office.  These discussions are crucial to the understanding of the foreign branches ’ or offices ’ operations, AML risks, and AML programs.  Also, the examination of 
the foreign branch or office should include a review of the U.S. bank’s involvement in managing or monitoring the foreign branch’s operations, internal control systems (e.g., policies, procedures, and monitoring reports), and, where available, the host country supervisors’ examination findings, audit findings, and workpapers.  As with all BSA/AML examinations, the extent of transaction testing and activities where it is performed is based on various factors including the examiner’s judgment of risks, controls, and the adequacy of the 
independent testing.  
--- Page 172 ---
Foreign Branches and Offices of U.S. Banks — Overview 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  167 2/27/2015.V2  Host Jurisdiction-Based Examinations  
On-site work in the host jurisdiction enables examiners not only to better understand the role 
of the U.S. bank in relation to its foreign branch or office but also, perhaps more importantly, 
permit examiners to dete rmine the extent to which the U.S. bank’s global policies, 
procedures, and processes are being followed locally. 
The standard scoping and planning process determine the focus of the examination and the 
resource needs .  There may be some differences in the examination process conducted 
abroad .  The host supervisory authority may send an examiner to join the U.S. team or 
request attendance at meetings at the beginning and at the conclusion of the examination.  AML reporting requirements also are likely to be different, as they are adjusted to local 
regulatory requirements. 
For both U.S.-based and host-based examinations of foreign branches and offices, the 
procedures used for specific products, services, customers, and entities are those found in this 
manual .  For example, if an examiner is looking at pouch activities at foreign branches and 
offices, he or she should use applicable expanded examination procedures.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  168 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Foreign Branches and Offices of U.S. Banks  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the U.S. bank’s systems to manage the risks associated 
with its foreign branches and offices, and management’ s ability to implement effective 
monitoring and reporting systems. 
1.Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to foreign branches and offices176
t
o evaluate their adequacy given the activity in relation to the bank’s risk, and assess
whether the controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering
and terrorist financing.
2. On the basis of a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the
U.S. bank’ s head office effectively identifies and monitors foreign branches and offices,
particularly those conducting higher -risk transac tions or located in higher-risk
jurisdictions.
3.Determine whether the U.S. bank ’s head office system for monitoring foreign branches
and offices and detecting unusual or suspicious activities at those branches and offices is
adequate given the bank ’s size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
Determine whether the host country requires reporting of suspicious activities and, ifpermitted and available, review those reports.  Determine whether this information isprovided to the U.S. bank ’s head office and filtered into a bank-wide or, if appropriate, a
firm-wide assessment of suspicious activities.
4.Review the bank ’s tiering or organizational structure report , which should include a list
of all legal entities and the countries in w hich they are registered .  Determine the
locations of foreign branches and offices, including the foreign regulatory environmentand the degree of access by U.S. regulators for on- site examinations and customer
records.
5. Review any partnering or outsourcing relationships of foreign branches and offices .
Determine whether the relationship is consistent with the bank ’s AML program.
6. Determine the type of products, services, customers, entities, and geographic locations
served by the foreign branches and offices .  Review the risk assessments of the foreign
branches and offices.
7. Review the management, compliance, and audit structure of the foreign branches and
offices .  Identify the decisions that are made at the bank ’s U.S. head office level versus
those that are made at the foreign branch or office.
8. Determine the involvement of the U.S. bank’s head office in managing and monitoring
foreign branches and offices .  Conduct a preliminary evaluation of the foreign branches
or offices through discussions with senior management at the U.S. bank’ s head office
(e.g., operations, customers, entities, jurisdictions, products, services, management

expansions, AML risks, and AML prog rams) .  Similar discussions should occur with 
management of the foreign branches and offices, particularly those that may be 
considered higher risk. 
9. Coordinate with the host country supervisor and, if applicable, U.S. federal and state
regulatory agenci es.  Discuss their assessment of the foreign branches ’ and offices ’
compliance with local laws .  Determine whether there are any restrictions on materials
that may be reviewed, copied, or taken out of the country.
10. If available, review the following:
•Previous regulatory examination reports.
•Host country’s regulatory examination report.
•Audit reports and supporting documentation.
•Compliance reviews and supporting documentation.
11. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of For eign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
12.Make a determination whether transaction testing is feasible.  If feasible on the basis of
the bank’s risk assessment of this activity and prior examination and audit reports, select
a sample of higher- risk foreign branch and office activity .  Complete transaction testing
from appropriate expanded examination procedures sections (e.g., pouch activity).
13. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated with the
U.S. bank’ s foreign branches and offices.

Parallel Banking — Overview 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  170 2/27/2015.V2  Parallel Banking — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
parallel banking relationships, and management’ s ability to implement effective due 
diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems. 
A parallel banking organization exists when at least one U.S. bank and one foreign financial 
institution are controlled either directly or indirectly by the same person or group of persons 
who are closely associated in their business dealings or otherwise acting together, but are not subject to consolidated supervision by a single home country supervisor.  The foreign financial institution is  subject to different money laundering rules and regulations and a 
different supervisory oversight structure, both of which may be less stringent than in the United  States .  The regulatory and supervisory differences heighten the BSA/AML risk 
associated with parallel banking organizations. 
Risk Factors  
Parallel banking organizations may have common management, share policies and procedures, cross-sell products, or ge nerally be linked to a foreign parallel financial 
institution in a number of ways.  The key money laundering concern regarding parallel banking organizations is that the U.S. bank may be exposed to greater risk through transactions with the foreign parallel financial institution .  Transactions may be facilitated 
and risks heightened because of the lack of arm’s-length dealing or reduced controls on transactions between banks that are linked or closely associated .  For example, officers or 
directors may be common to both entities or may be different but nonetheless work 
together.
177 
Risk Mitigation  
The U.S. bank’s policies, procedures, and processes for parallel banking relationships should 
be consistent with those for other foreign correspondent bank relationships .  In addition, 
parallel banks should: 
•Provide for independent lines of decision- making authority.
•Guard against c onflicts of interest.
•Ensure independent and arm’s- length dealings between the related entities.
177 For additional risks associated with parallel banking, refe r to the Joint Agency Statement on Parallel -Owned 
Banking Organizations  issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision, Apri l 23, 
2002.

Parallel Banking — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  171 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Parallel Banking 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
parallel banking relationships, and management’ s ability to implement effective due 
diligence, monitoring, and reporting syste ms. 
1. Determine whether parallel banking relationships exist through discussions with
management or by reviewing inter -party activities involving the bank and another foreign
financial institution .  Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to parallel
banking relationships.  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processesgiven the bank’s parallel banking activities and the risks they present.  Assess whetherthe controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and
terrorist financing.
2.Determine whether there are any conflicts of interest or differences in policies,
procedures, and processes between parallel bank relationships and other foreign
correspondent bank relationships.  Particular consideration should be given to funds
transfer, pouch, and payable through activities because these activities are morevulnerable to money laundering.  If the bank engages in any of these activities, examiners
should consider completing applicable expanded examination procedures that address
each of these topics.
3.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors parallel banking relationships, particularly those that
pose a higher- risk for money laundering.
4.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring parallel banking relationships for
suspicious activities, and for reporting suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’ s
size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
5. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
6. On the basis of the bank’ s  risk assessment of its parallel banking activities, as well as
prior ex amination and audit reports, select a sample of higher -risk activities from parallel
banking relationships (e.g., foreign correspondent banking, funds transfer, payablethrough accounts, and pouch).
7. Consider the location of the foreign parallel financia l institution .  If the jurisdiction is
higher risk, examiners should review a larger sample of transactions between the two
institutions .  Banks doing business with parallel foreign banking organizations in
countries not designated as higher risk may still require EDD, but that determination is
based on the size, nature, and type of the transactions between the institutions.

about the relationship between the two entities, recommend that this information be
forwarded to the appropriate supervisory authorities.

Correspondent Accounts (Domestic) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  173 2/27/2015.V2  EXPANDED EXAMINATION  OVERVIEW AND 
PROCEDURES FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  
Correspondent Accounts (Domestic) — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
offering domestic correspondent account relationships, and management’ s ability to 
implement effective monitoring and reporting systems.  
Banks maintain correspondent relationships at other domestic banks to provide certain 
services that can be performed more economically or efficiently because of the other bank’s size, expertise in a specific line of business, or geographic location .  Such services may 
include: 
•Deposit accounts .  Assets known as “due from bank deposits” or “correspondent bank
balances” may represent the bank’s primary operating account.
•Funds transfers .  A transfer of funds between banks may result from the collection of
checks or other cash items, transfer and settlement of securities transactions, transfer of
participating loan funds, purchase or sale of federal funds, or processing of customer
transactions.
•Other services .  Services include processing loan participations, facilitating secondary
market loan sales, performing data processing and payroll services, and exchangingforeign currency.
Bankers’ Banks  
A bankers’ bank, which is organized and chartered to do business with other banks, is 
generally owned by the banks it  services .  Bankers’ banks, which do not conduct business 
directly with the public, offer correspondent banking services to independent community banks, thrifts, credit unions, and real estate investment trusts.  Bankers’ banks provide services directly, t hrough outsourcing arrangements, or by sponsoring or endorsing third 
parties .  The products bankers’ banks offer normally consist of traditional correspondent 
banking services.  Bankers’ banks should have risk- based policies, procedures, and processes 
to manage the BSA/AML risks involved in these correspondent relationships to detect and 
report suspicious activities.  
Generally, a bankers’ bank signs a service agreement with the respondent bank
178 outlining 
each party’s responsibilities .  The service agreement  may include the following:  
•Products and services provided.
•Responsibility for record keeping (e.g., CTRs  filed).
•Responsibility for task performed (e.g., OFAC filtering).
178 A respondent bank is any bank for which another bank establishes, maintains, administers, or manages a 
correspondent account relationship.  
--- Page 179 ---
Correspondent Accounts (Domestic) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  174 2/27/2015.V2  •Review of oversight documentation (e.g., audit and consultants reports).
Risk Factors 
Because domestic banks must follow the same regulatory requirements, BSA/AML risks in 
domestic correspondent banking, including bankers’ banks, are minimal in comparison to other types of financial services, especially for proprietary accounts (i.e., the domestic bank is using the correspondent account for its own transactions).  Each bank, however, has its own approach for conducting its BSA/AML compliance program, including customer due diligence, MIS , account monitoring, and reporting suspicious activities .  Furthermore, while 
a domestic correspondent account may not be considered higher risk, transactions through the account, which may be conducted on behalf of the respondent’s customer, may be higher risk.  Money laundering risks can be heightened when a respondent bank allows its 
customers to direct or execute transactions through the correspondent account, especially 
when such transactions are directed or executed through an ostensibly proprietary account. 
The correspondent bank also faces heightened risks when providing direct currency 
shipments for customers of respondent banks.  This is not to imply that such activities necessarily entail money laundering, but these direct currency shipments should be appropriately monitored for unusual and s uspicious activity .  Without such a monitoring 
system, the correspondent bank is essentially providing these direct services to an unknown 
customer.  
Risk Mitigation  
Banks that offer correspondent bank services to respondent banks should have policies, 
procedures, and processes to manage the BSA/AML risks involved in these correspondent relationships and to detect and report suspicious activities.  Banks should ascertain whether domestic correspondent accounts are proprietary or allow third -party transaction s.  When the 
respondent bank allows third -party customers to transact business through the correspondent 
account, the correspondent bank should ensure that it understands the due diligence and 
monitoring procedures applied by the respondent on its customer s that utiliz e the account.  
The level of risk varies depending on the services provided and the types of transactions 
conducted through the account and the respondent bank’s BSA/AML compliance program, products, services, customers, entities, and geographi c locations .  Each bank should 
appropriately monitor transactions of domestic correspondent accounts relative to the level of assessed risk .  In addition, domestic banks are independently responsible for OFAC 
compliance for any transactions that flow through their banks.  Appropriate filtering should be in place.  Refer to core overview section and examination procedures, “Office of Foreign 
Assets Control,” page  142 and 152, respectively .

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  175 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Correspondent Accounts (Domestic)  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
offering domestic correspondent account relationships, and management’ s ability to 
implement effective monitoring and reporting systems. 
1.Review the policies, procedures, and processes, and any bank service agreements related
to domestic correspondent banking relationships.  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies,procedures, and processes given the bank’s domestic correspondent accounts and therisks they present.  Assess whether the controls are adequate to reasonably protect the
bank from money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether  the bank has
identified any domestic correspondent banking activities as higher risk.
3.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring domestic correspondent accounts
for suspicious activities, and for reporting suspicious activities, is adequate given the
bank’s size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
4. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance .
Transaction Testing  
5. On the basis of the bank’ s  review  of respondent accounts179 with unusual or higher- risk
activity, its risk assessment, and prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of
respondent accounts.  From the sample selected, perform the following examination
procedures:
•Review bank statem ents for domestic correspondent accounts.
•Review large or unusual transactions to determine their nature.  As necessary, obtain
and review copies of credit or debit advices, general ledger tickets, and other
supporting documentation.
•Note any currency ship ments or deposits made on behalf of a respondent bank’ s
customer .  Based on this information determine whether:
− Currency shipments are adequately documented.
− The respondent bank has performed due diligence on customers that conduct large
currency transacti ons. 
− CTRs  are properly filed and activity is commensurate with expected activity.  
6. Review the bank statements for domestic correspondent account records, or telex records
of accounts controlled by the same person for large deposits of cashier’ s checks, m oney

Correspondent Accounts (Foreign) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  177 2/27/2015.V2  Correspondent Accounts (Foreign)  — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the U.S. bank’s systems to manage the risks associated 
with foreign correspondent banking and management’ s ability to implement effective due 
diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems.  This section expands the earlier core review of statutory and regulatory requirements of foreign correspondent account relationships in 
order to provide a broader assessment of the AML risks associated with this activity. 
Foreign financ ial institutions
180 maintain accounts at U.S. banks to gain access to the U.S. 
financial system and to take advantage of services and products that may not be available in 
the foreign financial institution ’s jurisdiction .  These services may be performed more 
economically or efficiently by the U.S. bank or may be necessary for other reasons, such as 
the facilitation of international trade .  Services may include:  
•Cash management services, including deposit accounts.
•International funds transfers.
•Check clearing.
•Payable through accounts.
•Pouch activities.
•Foreign exchange services.
•Overnight investment accounts (sweep accounts).
•Loans and letters of credit.
•Lines of credit.
Contractual Agreements  
Each relationship that a U.S. bank has with a foreign correspondent financial institution 
should be governed by an agreement or a contract describing each party’s responsibilities and other relationship details (e.g., products and services provided, acceptance of deposits, clearing of items, forms of payment, and acceptable forms of endorsement) .  The agreement 
or contract should also consider the foreign financial institution’s AML regulatory requirements, customer base, due diligence procedures, and permitted third -party usage of 
the correspondent account. 
180 The term “foreign financial institution” as defined in 31 CFR 1010.605(f) generally includes:  
•A foreign bank.
•A foreign branch or office of a U.S. bank, broker/dealer in securities, futures commission merchant,
intro ducing broker, or mutual fund.
•Any other person organized under foreign law that, if located in the United States, would be a
broker/dealer in securities, futures commission merchant, introducing broker, or mutual fund.
•Any person organized under foreign l aw that is engaged in the business of, and is readily identifiable as,
a currency dealer or exchanger or a money transmitter.

Correspondent Accounts (Foreign) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  178 2/27/2015.V2  Risk Factors 
Some foreign financial institutions are not subject to the same or similar regulatory 
guidelines as U.S. banks; therefore, these foreign institutions may pose a higher money laundering risk to their respective U.S. bank correspondent(s).  Investigations have disclosed that, in the past, foreign correspondent accounts have been used by drug traffickers and other criminal elements to launder funds .  Shell companies are sometimes used in the layering 
process to hide the true ownership of accounts at foreign correspondent financial institutions.  Because of the large amount of funds, multiple transactions, and the U.S. bank’ s potential 
lack of familiarity with the foreign correspondent financial institution ’s customer, criminals 
and terrorists can more e asily conceal the source and use of illicit funds .  Consequently, each 
U.S. bank, including all overseas branches, offices, and subsidiaries, should closely monitor 
transactions related to foreign correspondent accounts. 
Without adequate controls, a U.S. bank may also set up a traditional correspondent account 
with a foreign financial institution and not be aware that the foreign financial institution is permitting other financial institutions, or customers to conduct transactions anonymously 
through the U.S. bank account (e.g., payable through accounts
181 and nested accounts). 
Nested Accounts  
Nested accounts occur when a foreign financial institution gains access to the U.S. financial system by operating through a U.S. correspondent account belonging to another foreign financial institution .  If the U.S. bank is unaware that its foreign correspondent financial 
institution  customer is providing such access to third-party foreign financial institutions, 
these third -party financial institutions can effectively ga in anonymous access to the U.S. 
financial system .  Unacceptable nested activity and  other activity of concern may be 
characterized by transactions to jurisdictions in which the foreign financial institution has no 
known business activities or interests and transactions in which the total volume and frequency significantly exceeds expected activity for the foreign financial institution, 
considering its customer base or asset size.   U.S. banks should also focus on nested account 
transactions with any entities the bank has designated as higher risk.  
Risk Mitigation  
U.S. banks that offer foreign correspondent financial institution services s hould have 
policies, procedures, and processes to manage the BSA/AML risks inherent with these relationships and should closely monitor transactions related to these accounts to detect and report suspicious activities .  The level of risk varies depending on the foreign financial 
institution ’s strategic profile, including its size and geographic locations, the products and 
services  it offers , and the markets and customers it serves.  The Clearing House Association , 
LLC. , and The Wolfsberg Group have published suggested industry standards and guidance 
for banks that provide foreign correspondent banking services.
182 When dealing with foreign 
correspondent account relationships, it is important for the bank to keep in mind regulatory requirements related to speci al measures issued under 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act 
181 Refer to the expanded overview section, “Payable Through Accounts,” page 194, for additional information.  
182 Refer to Guidelines for Counter Money Laundering Policies and Procedures in Correspondent Banking  and 
the Wolfsberg AML Principles for Correspondent Banking .

information relating to risk assessments and due diligence is contained in the core overview 
section , “Foreign Correspondent Account Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Due Diligence,” 
page 111. 
The U.S. bank’s policies, procedures, and processes should: 
•Specify appropriate account -opening/on-boarding procedures, which may include
minimum levels of documentation to be obtained from prospective customers; an account
review and approval process that is independent of the correspondent account business
line for potential higher -risk customers; and a description of circumstances when the
bank does not open an account.
•Assess the risks posed by a prospective foreign correspondent customer relationship
utilizing consistent, well-documented risk-rating methodologies, and incorporate that risk
determination into the bank’s suspicious activity monitoring system.
•Understand the inte nded use and purpose of the accounts and expected account activity
(e.g., determine whether the relationship serves as a payable through account).
•Understand the foreign correspondent financial institution’s other correspondent
relationships (e.g., determi ne whether and how nested accounts are to  be utilized).
•Conduct adequate and ongoing due diligence on the foreign correspondent financialinstitution relationships, which may include periodic site visits  based on risk.
•Determine whether the foreign correspondent financial institution has in place acceptable
AML compliance processes and controls.
•Ensure that appropriate due diligence standards are applied to those accounts determinedto be higher risk.
•Ensure that foreign correspondent financial institution  relationships are appropriately
included within the U.S. bank’s suspicious activity monitoring and reporting systems.
•Follow up on account activity and transactions that do not fit the foreign financial
institution customer’s strategic profile (i.e., transactions involving customers, industries
or products that are not generally part of that foreign financial institution’s customer base
or market).
•Establish a formalized process for escalating suspicious information on potential and
existing cus tomers to an appropriate management level for review.
•Establish criteria for closing the foreign correspondent financial institution account.
As a sound practice, U.S. banks are encouraged to communicat e their AML -related 
expectations to their foreign correspondent financial institution customers.  Moreover, the U.S. bank should generally understand and assess the quality of the AML controls at the foreign correspondent financial institution, including customer due diligence practices, suspicious activity identification processes, and recordkeeping documentation.  They should

Correspondent Accounts (Foreign)  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the U.S. bank’s systems to manage the risks associated 
with foreign correspondent banking and management’ s ability to implement effective  due 
diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems.  This section expands the earlier core review of statutory and regulatory requirements of foreign correspondent account relationships in 
order to provide a broader assessment of the AML risks associated wi th this activity.  
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to foreign correspondent financial
institution account relationships.  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and
processes .  Assess whether the controls are adequate t o reasonably protect the U.S. bank
from money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.From a review of MIS and internal risk -rating factors, determine whether the U.S. bank
effectively identifies and monitors foreign correspondent financial institution account
relationships, particularly those that pose a higher risk for money laundering.
3. If the U.S. bank has a standardized foreign correspondent agreement, review a sample
agreement to determine whether each party ’s responsibilities, products, and services
provided, and allowable third party usage of the correspondent account, are covered
under the contractual arrangement.  If the U.S. bank does not have a standardized
agreement, refer to the transaction testing examination procedures.
4.Deter mine whether the U.S. bank’s system for monitoring foreign correspondent
financial institution account relationships for suspicious activities, and for reporting
suspicious activities, is adequate given the U.S. bank’s size, complexity, location, and
types  of customer relationships.
5. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
6. On the basis of the U.S. bank’s risk assessment of its foreign correspondent activit i es, as
well as prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of higher-risk foreign
correspondent financial institution account relationships.  The higher-risk sample should
include relationships with foreign financial institutions located in juris dictions that do not
cooperate with international AML efforts and in other jurisdictions that the U.S. bank has
determined pose a higher risk .  From the sample selected, perform the following
examination procedures:
•Review a foreign correspondent agreement  or contract that delineates each party ’s
responsibilities and the products and services provided.
•Review U.S. bank statements for foreign correspondent accounts and, as necessary,
specific transaction details .  Compare expected transactions with actual activity.

Correspondent Accounts (Foreign) — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  182 2/27/2015.V2  •Determine whether actual activity is consistent with the nature of the customer ’s
business.  Identify any unusual or suspicious activity.
•Review large or unusual transactions to determine their nature.  As necessary, obtain
and review copies of credit or debit advices, general ledger tickets, and other
supporting documentation.
•Analyze transactions to identify behavior indicative of nested accounts, intermediary
or clearing agent services, or other services for third- party foreign financial
institutions that have not been clearly identified.
7. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated with
foreign correspondent financial i nstitution  relationships.

Bulk Shipments of Currency — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  183 2/27/2015.V2  Bulk Shipments of Currency — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the U.S. bank’s systems to manage the risks associated 
with receiving and sending bulk shipments of currency and management’s implementation of 
effective monitoring and reporting systems. 
Bulk shipments of currency , sometimes referred to as wholesale cash,  entail s the 
transportation of  large volumes of U.S. or foreign bank notes.  Bulk shipments of currency 
can be sent  from sources either inside or outside the United States to a bank in the United 
States.  Shipments are also made from a bank in the United St ates to a recipient in a foreign 
jurisdiction .   
This business uses common carrier s of currency , private couriers, or the Postal Service to 
physically transport shipments.183  These shipments can involve pedestrians, rai lways , roads, 
sea or air .  Often, but not always, shipments take the form of containerized cargo.  
Regardless of the business model employed, each physical transportation involves multiple parties that are responsible for fulfilling one or more specific roles in the delivery process. 
FinCEN guidance defines these roles to include:
184 
•the common c arrier ,
•the shipper,
•the consignee,
•the currency o riginator, and
•the currency recipient.
Typically, a common carrier of currency transports currency or other monetary instruments 
as a business, for a person that engages the carrier for a fee (the “shipper”), from one place to 
another, to be delivered to the person appointed by the shipper to receive the currency or monetary instruments (the “consignee”).  The shipper may be acting of its own accord or on instructions from a different person (the “currency originator”), and the consignee may be instructed to deliver the currency or other monetary instruments to the account of a final beneficiary (the “currency recipient”).  The same person may fulfill more than one role in the 
same shipment.  
The same person may be both the shipper, and the currency originator (i.e., individuals or 
businesses that generate currency from cash sales of commodities or other products or services (including monetary instruments or exchanges of currency).  Shippers also may be 
183 31 CFR 1010.100(k) defines “common carrier” as any person engaged in the business of transporting 
individuals or goods for a fee who holds itself out as ready to engage in such transportation for hire and who 
undertakes to do so indiscriminately for all persons who are prepared to pay the fee for the particular service 
offered.  This section addresses a subgroup of common carriers, those persons engaged as a business in the transportation of currency, other monetary instruments, or commercial papers, referred to herein as “common carriers of currency.”  An armored car service is a type of this subgroup of common carriers.  
184 Refer to CMIR guidance for common carriers of curre ncy, including armored car services , FIN -2014- G002,

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  184 2/27/2015.V2  intermediari es that ship currency gathered from other shippers, who in turn are gathering 
currency from their customers who are currency originators .  Intermediaries may be other 
banks, central banks, nondeposit financial institutions, or agents of these entities. 
Banks receive bulk shipments of currency directly when they take possession of an actual 
shipment.  Banks receive bulk shipments of currency indirectly when they take possession of 
the economic equivalent of a currency shipment, such as through a cash letter notification  or 
deposit into the bank’s account at the Federal Reserve.  In the case of a shipment received 
indirectly, the actual shipment usually moves toward the bank only as far as a Federal Reserve Bank or branch, where the value of the currency becomes recorded as held on the bank’s behalf.  Wh ether the shipment to or from the bank is direct or indirect, banks are 
required to report the receipt or disbursement of currency in excess of $10,000 via a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) (31 CFR 1010.311) subject to the exemptions at 31 CFR 1020.315.  Note that most categories of CTR exempt persons apply only to the extent of the exempt person’s domestic operations, 31 CFR 1020.315(b)(1-7).  For more information on 
CTRs refer to the Currency Transaction Repo rting Overview on page 81. 
Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments 
Subject to certain exemptions, each person  who physically transports, mails or ships, or 
causes to be physically transported, mailed, or shipped currency or other monetary 
instruments , is require d to report shipments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 
received from or shipped to locations outside the U.S. via a Report of International 
Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR)  (31 CFR 1010.340)  For more 
information on CMIRs refer to the International Transportation of Currency or Monetary 
Instruments Overview on page 139.   
Regardless of whether an exemption from filing a CMIR or CTR applies, banks must still 
monitor for, and report, suspicious activity.   
Risk Factors  
Bulk shipments of currency to banks from shippers that are presumed to be reputable may 
nevertheless originate from illicit activity .  The monetary proceeds of criminal activities, for 
example, often reappear in the financial system as seemingly legitimate funds that have been 
placed and finally integrated by flowing through numerous intermediaries and layered transactions that disguise the origin of the funds.  Layering can include shipments to or through other jurisdictions.  Accordingly, banks that receive direct or indirect bulk shipments 
of currency risk becoming complicit in money laundering or terrorist financing schemes.  
In recent years, the smuggling of bulk currency has become a preferred method for movi ng 
illicit funds across borders.
185  Because bulk cash that is smuggled out of the United S tates is 
usually denominated in U.S. dollars, those who receive the smuggled bulk cash must find 
185 Refer to U.S. Money Laundering Threat Assessment  (December 2005) on page 33.  Congres s criminalized 
the act of smuggling large amounts of cash as part of the USA PATRIOT Act.  Specifically, 31 USC 5332 -Bulk 
Cash Smuggling makes it a crime to smuggle or attempt to smuggle over $10,000 in currency or other monetary 
instruments into or out of  the United States, with the specific intent to evade the U.S. currency -reporting 
requirements codified in 31 USC 5316.

Bulk Shipments of Currency — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  185 2/27/2015.V2  ways to re -integrate the currency into the global bank ing system.  Oft en, this occurs through 
the use of a foreign financial institution, many times a  money services business, that 
wittingly or unwittingly receives the illicit U.S .-dollar denominated proceeds, and then 
originates a cash letter instrument (or a funds transfer ) for processing by, or deposit into, a 
U.S. bank.  The foreign financial institution then initiates the process of physically 
repatriating (shipping) the cash back into the United S tates.186 Experience has shown a direct 
correlation between the smuggling of bulk currency, the heightened use of wire transfers, remote deposit capture (RDC) transactions or cash letter instruments  from certain foreign 
financial institutions  and/or jurisdictions, and bulk shipments of currency into the United 
States from the same  foreign financial institutions  or jurisdictions.
187  
The activity of shipping currency in bulk is not necessarily indicative of criminal or terrorist activity .  Many individuals and businesses, both domestic and foreign, generate currency 
from legitimate ca sh sales of commodities or other products or services or certain industries 
such as tourism or commerce.  Also, intermediaries gather and ship currency from single or multiple currency originators whose activities are legitimate .  Banks may legitimately offer 
services to receive such shipments .  However , banks should be aware of the potential misuse 
of their services by shippers of bulk currency.  Banks should also guard against introducing 
the monetary proceeds of criminal or terrorist activity into the financial system .  Banks 
should have a clear understanding of the appropriate volumes of currency shipments that are commensurate with the currency originator’s or shipper’s profile (size, location, strategic 
focus, customer base, geographic footprint) and the economic activity that generates the cash. 
To inform banks on the topic of bulk currency shipments, FinCEN has issued a number of 
advisor ies that set forth certain activities that may be associated with currency smuggling.
188 
According to FinCEN, U.S. law enforcement has observed a dramatic increase in the 
smuggling of bulk cash proceeds from the sale of narcotics and other criminal activities from the United States into Mexico .  Although the FinCEN advisor ies deal specifically with the 
shipment of bulk currency to and from the United S tates and Mexico, the issues discussed 
could be pertinent to shipping bulk currency to and from other jurisdictions as well.  Banks 
should look at each situation on a case by cas e basis.  
Law enforcement has identified the following activities that, in various combinations, may be associated with currency smuggling:
189 
186 In certain cases, the foreign financial institution will ship the cash to its central bank or a money center bank 
in the foreign count ry in which the cash letter instrument originated.  Sometimes numerous layered transactions 
are used to disguise the origins of the cash, after which the currency may be returned directly to the United 
States or further shipped to or through other jurisdic tions.  The cash will be repatriated back to the United States 
for the account of the U.S. bank in which the cash letter instrument was processed or funds transfer deposit was made.  
187 For an example of these types of transactions, refer to National Drug In telligence Center’s National Drug 
Threat Assessment 2008, Illicit Finance (December 2007).  
188 Refer to FinCEN’s Website  for advisories on the shipment of bulk currency to and from  the United States.

institutions by U.S. banks.
•Small denomination U.S. bank notes smuggled into a foreign country being exchanged
for large denomination U.S. bank notes possessed by foreign financial institutions.
•Large volumes of small denomination U.S. bank notes being sent from foreign nonbank
financial institutions to their accounts in the United States via armored transport, or sold
directly to U.S. banks.
•Multiple wire transfers initiated by foreign nonbank financial institutions that direct U.S.
banks to remit funds to other jurisdictions that bear no apparent business relationshipwith that foreign nonbank financial institution (recipients include individuals, businesses,
and other entities in free trade zones and other locations).
•The exchange of small denomination U.S. bank notes for large denomination U.S. bank
notes that may be sent to foreign countries.
•Deposits by foreign nonbank financial institutions to their accounts at U.S. banks that
include third- party items (including sequentially numbered monetary instruments).

•Structuring of currency deposits into an account in one geographic area, with the funds
subsequently withdrawn in a different geographic region with little time elapsing betweendeposit and withdrawal.  This is usually known as “funnel account” or “interstate cash”
activity.
Risk Mitigation  
U.S. banks that offer services to receive bulk shipments of currency should have policies, 
procedures, and processes in place that mitigate and manage the BSA/AML risks associated with the receipt of bulk currency shipments.  Banks should also closely monitor bulk currency shipment transactions to detect and report suspicious activity, with particular emphasis on the source of funds and the reasonableness of transaction volumes from 
currency originators and i ntermediaries.  
Risk m itigation begins with an effective risk assessment process that distinguishes 
relationships and transactions that present a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist 
financing .  Risk assessment processes should consider currency originator and i ntermediary 
ownership, geographies, economic factors and the nature, source, location, and control of 
bulk currency.  For a dditional information relating to risk assessments and due diligence, 
refer to the core overview sections “BSA/AML Risk Assessment” on page 18 and “Customer 
Due Diligenc e” on page 56.  
A U.S. bank’s policies, procedures, and processes should:  
•Specify appropriate risk -based relationship opening procedures, which may include
minimum levels of documentation to be obtained  from prospective currency originators
--- Page 192 ---
Bulk Shipments of Currency — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  187 2/27/2015.V2  and i ntermedia ries; specif y relationship approval process that, for potential higher- risk 
relationships, is independent of the business line and may include a visit to the 
prospective shipper or shipping- preparation sites; and describe the circumstances under 
which  the bank does not open a relationship. 
•Determine the intended use of the relationship, the expected volumes, frequency of
activity arising from transactions, sources of funds, reasonableness of volumes based on
originators and shippers (e.g., based on siz e, location, strategic focus, customer base,
geographic footprint) , economic and regulatory conditions that may affect currency
circulation and any required BSA reporting obligations (CTRs, CMIRs, etc. ).
•Identify the characteristics of acceptable and unacc eptable transactions, including
circumstances when the bank does or does not accept bulk currency shipments.
•Assess the risks posed by a prospective shipping relationship using consistent, well-documented risk- rating methodologies.
•Incorporate risk assessments, as appropriate, into the bank’s customer due diligence,EDD, and suspicious activity monitoring systems.
•Require adequate and ongoing due diligence once the relationship is established, which,
as appropriate, may include peri odic visits to the shipper and to shipping- preparation
sites.  As necessary, scrutinize the root source of cash shipments for reasonableness and
legitimacy  using risk -based processes.
•Ensure that appropriate due diligence standards are applied to relationships determined to
be higher risk.
•Include procedures for processing shipments, including employee responsibilities,
controls, reconciliation and documentation requirements, and employee/management
authorizations.
•Establish a process for escalating suspicious information on potential and existing
currency originator and intermediary relationships and transactions to an appropriate
management level for review.
•Refuse shipments having questionable or suspicious origins.
•Ensure that shipping relationships and comparisons of expected vs. actual shippingvolumes are included, as appropriate, within the U.S. bank’s systems for monitoring and
reporting suspicious activity.
•Establish criteria for terminating a shipping relationship.
•Ensure that shipments involving the foreign correspondent relationships are covered by
the bank’s due diligence program for correspondent accounts for foreign financial
institutions.

--- Page 193 ---
Bulk Shipments of Currency — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  188 2/27/2015.V2  banks.  U.S. banks also should understand the BSA/AML controls that apply to, or are 
otherwise adopted by, the currency originator , shipper, or intermediary, including any 
customer due diligence and recordkeeping requirements or practices.  
Other bank controls may also prove useful in protecting banks against illicit bulk shipments of currency.  These may include effective controls over foreign correspondent banking 
activity, pouch activity, funds transfers, international Automated Clearing House 
transactions, and remote deposit capture. 
Contractual Agreements 
U.S. banks should establish agreements or contracts with c urrency originators , shippers, 
intermediaries , and/ or established common carriers  such as the ones that are allowed to 
deliver directly to the bank’s vault.191  The agreement or contract should describe each 
party’s responsibilities and other relevant details of the relationship .  The agreement or 
contract should reflect and be consistent with any BSA/AML considerations that apply to the 
bank, the common carrier, currency originator or intermediary, and the ir customers .  The 
agreement or contract should also address expectations about due diligence and permitted  use of the shipper’s services  by third parties .  While agreements and contracts should also 
provide for respective BSA/AML controls, obligations, and considerations, U.S. banks 
cannot shift their BSA/AML responsibilities to others.

Bulk Shipments  of Currency — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  189 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Bulk Shipments of Currency  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the U.S. bank’s systems to manage the risks associated 
with receiving and sending bulk shipments of currency, and management’s ability to 
implement effective due diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems.  
1.Determine whether the bank receives or distributes shipments of bulk currency.
2. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to receiving shipments of bulk
currency  for adequacy , given the activity and the risks presented.
3.Review the list of currency originators , shippers, and intermediaries that send bulk
currency shipments to the bank.
4.Determine whether management has assessed the risks associated with receiving bulk
currency  shipments from particular currency originators , shippers, and i ntermediaries .
Consider the source of the currency originator , shipper, or intermediary’s currency and
the reasonableness of transaction volumes.  Assess the adequacy of the risk- assessment
methodology.
5.From a review of MIS and internal risk -rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors relationships with currency originators and
intermediaries, particularly those that pose a higher risk for money laundering or terrorist
financing.
6.If the bank has a standardized agreement or contract with currency originators , shippers,
intermediaries, and/or established common carriers, review a sample agreement or
contract to determine whether each party’s responsibilities, p roducts, and services
provided, and allowable usage of the relationship by third -parties , including the parties’
BSA/AML responsibilities, are covered .  If the bank does not have a standardized
agreement or contract, refer to the transaction testing examin ation procedures below.
7. Determine whether the bank files required BSA reports (e.g., CTRs or CMIRs), if
applicable.
8. Determine whether the bank’s system for monitoring and reporting suspicious activities
related to shipping relationships and transactions is adequate given the bank’s size,complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
9.Determine whether the b ank is monitoring for expected versus actual shipping volumes
and taking action in response to unusual or inordinate increase in volumes or patterns.
Transaction Testing  
10. Based on the bank’s risk assessment of its relationships with c urrency originators ,
shippers, and i ntermediaries,  as well as prior examination and audit reports, select a
sample of currency o riginators , shippers, or intermediaries  and recent bulk currency
shipments.  The sample should include relationships with c urrency originators , shipper s,
and intermediaries located in or shipping from, jurisdictions that may pose a higher risk

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  190 2/27/2015.V2  for money laundering and terrorist financing, or that participate in businesses that may 
pose a higher risk for money laundering and terrorist financing.  
11.Preferab ly on an unannounced basis and over a period of several days, observe the
process for accepting shipments of bulk currency .  Review the records and the shipments
for irregularities .  From the samples selected, perform the following examination
procedures:
•Review for completeness a relationship agreement or contract that delineates each
party’s responsibilities and the products and services provided.
•Review U.S. bank statements of accounts and, as necessary, specific transactiondetails.
•Review vault control records for bulk currency shipment transactions (in and out) toidentify large denomination activity as a result of small denomination exchanges.
•Assess the reasonableness of customer due diligence and EDD  information pertaining
to the sampled currency originators , shippers, and intermediaries.
•Determine whether the nature, volume, and frequency of activity are consistent with
the expectations associated with the currency originator, shipper, and i ntermediary .
Discuss any inconsistencies identified  with bank management.  As necessary, obtain
and review copies of credit or debit advices, general ledger tickets, and other
supporting documentation.
•Review unusual transactions and customer due diligence information to determine if
transactions are potentially suspicious.
•Discuss preliminary findings and conclusions with bank management.
12.If the currency originator, shipper, or intermediary, or the referral agent who works for
the currency originator, shipper, or intermediary has an account with the bank, review a
sample of account activity.
13. Based on the examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated with the

U.S. Dollar Drafts — Overvie w 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  191 2/27/2015.V2  U.S. Dollar Drafts — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
U.S. dollar drafts, and management’ s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting 
systems.  
A U.S. dollar draft is a bank draft or check denominated in U.S. dollars and made available at foreign financial institutions .  These drafts are drawn on a U.S. correspondent account by a 
foreign financial institution .  Drafts are freque ntly purchased to pay for commercial or 
personal transactions and to settle overseas obligations. 
Risk Factors  
The majority of U.S dollar drafts are legitimate; however, drafts have proven to be vulnerable to money laundering abuse.  Such schemes involving U.S. dollar drafts could involve the smuggling of U.S. currency to a foreign financial institution for the purchase of a check or draft denominated in U.S. dollars.  The foreign financial institution accepts the U.S. currency and issues a U.S. dollar draft drawn against its U.S. correspondent bank account.  Once the currency is in bank draft form, the money launderer can more easily conceal the source of funds.  The ability to convert illicit proceeds to a bank draft at a foreign financial institution 
makes it easier for a money launderer to transport the instrument either back into the United States or to endorse it to a third party in a jurisdiction where money laundering laws or compliance are lax .  In any case, the individual has laundered illicit proce eds; ultimately, the 
draft or check is returned for processing at the U.S. correspondent bank. 
Risk Mitigation  
A U.S. bank’s policies, procedures, and processes should include the following: 
•Outline criteria for opening a U.S. dollar draft relationship wit h a foreign financial
institution or entity (e.g., jurisdiction; products, services, target market; purpose of
account and anticipated activity; or customer history).
•Detail acceptable and unacceptable transactions (e.g., structuring transactions or the
purchase of multiple sequentially numbered drafts for the same payee).
•Detail the monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity associated with U.S. dollardrafts.
•Discuss criteria for closing U.S. dollar draft relationships.

U.S. Dollar Drafts — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  192 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
U.S. Dollar Drafts 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
U.S. dollar drafts, and management’s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting 
systems.  
1.Review  the policies, procedures, and processes related to U.S. dollar drafts .  Evaluate the
adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’s U.S. dollar draft
activities and the risks they present.  Assess whether the controls are adequate toreasonably protect the bank from money laundering and terrorist financing .  Determine
whether policies address the following:
•Criteria for allowing a foreign financial institution or entity to issue the U.S. bank ’s
dollar drafts (e.g., jurisdiction; products, services, and target markets; purpose of
account and anticipated activity; customer history; and other available information).
•Identification of unusual transactions (e.g., structuring transactions or the purchase of
multiple sequentially numbered U.S. dollar drafts to the same payee).
•Criteria for ceasing U.S. dollar draft issuance through a foreign financial institution or
entity.
2.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors higher-risk U.S. dollar draft accounts.
3.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring U.S. dollar draft accounts for
suspicious activities, and for reporting suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’ s
size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
4. Obtain a list of foreign bank correspondent accounts in which U.S. dollar drafts are
offered .  Review the volume, by number and dollar amount, of monthly transactions for
each account .  Determine whether management has appropr iately assessed risk.
Transaction Testing  
5. On the basis of the bank’ s risk assessment of its U.S. dollar draft activities, as well as
prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of foreign correspondent bank
accounts in which U.S. dollar drafts are processed .  In the sample selected, include
accounts with a high volume of U.S. dollar draft activity.  From the sample selected,
perform the following examination procedures:
•Review transactions for sequentially numbered U.S. dollar drafts to the same payee or
from the same remitter .  Research any unusual or suspicious U.S. dollar draft
transactions.
•Review the bank ’s contracts and agreements with foreign correspondent banks.
Determine whether contracts address procedures for processing and clearing U .S.
dollar drafts.

 Payable Through Accounts — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  194 2/27/2015.V2  Payable Through Accounts — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
payable through accounts (PTA), and management’ s ability to implement effective 
monitoring and reporting systems.  
Foreign financial institutions use PTAs, also known as “pass-through” or “pass-by” accounts, 
to provide their customers with access to the U.S. banking system.  Some U.S. banks, Edge and agreement corporations, and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign financial institutions 
(collectively referred to as U. S. banks) offer these accounts as a service to foreign financial 
institutions .  Law enforcement authorities have stated that the risk of money laundering and 
other illicit activities is higher in PTAs  that are not adequately controlled. 
Generally, a foreig n financial institution requests a PTA for its customers that want to 
conduct banking transactions in the United States through the foreign financial institution’ s 
account at a U.S. bank.  The foreign financial institution provides its customers, commonly referred to as “subaccountholders,” with checks that allow them to draw funds from the 
foreign financial institution ’s account at the U.S. bank.
192 The subaccountholders, which may 
number several hundred or in the thousands for one PTA, all become signatories on the foreign financial institution ’s account at the U.S. bank.  While payable through customers are 
able to write checks and make deposits at a bank in the United States like any other accountholder, they might not be directly subject to the bank’ s account opening requirements 
in the United States.  
PTA activities should not be confused with traditional international correspondent banking relationships, in which a foreign financial institution enters into an agreement with a U.S. bank to process and complete transactions on behalf of the foreign financial institution and its customers .  Under the latter correspondent arrangement, the foreign financial institution’ s 
customers do not have direct access to the correspondent account at the U.S. bank, but t hey 
do transact business through the U.S. bank.  This arrangement differs significantly from a 
PTA with sub accountholders who have direct access to the U.S. bank by virtue of their 
independent ability to conduct transactions with the U.S. bank through the PTA . 
Risk Factors  
PTAs may be prone to higher risk because U.S. banks do not typically implement the same due diligence requirements for PTAs that they require of domestic customers who want to open checking and other accounts.  For example, some U.S. banks merely request a copy of signature cards completed by the payable through customers (the customer of the foreign financial institution) .  These U.S. banks then process thousands of subaccountholder checks 
and other transactions, including currency deposits, through the foreign financial institution’ s 
PTA .  In most cases, little or no independent effort is expended to obtain or confirm 
information about the individual and business subaccountholders that use the PTAs. 
Foreign financial institutions ’ use of PTAs, coupled with inadequate oversight by U.S. banks, 
may facilitate unsound banking practices, including money laundering and related criminal 
192 In this type of relationship, the foreign financial institution is commonly referred to as the “master 
accountholder.” 
--- Page 200 ---
 Payable Through Accounts — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  195 2/27/2015.V2  activities .  The potential for facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing, OFAC 
violations, and other serious crimes increases when a U.S. bank is unable to identify and 
adequately understand the transactions of the ultimate users (all or most of whom are outside of the United States) of its account with a foreign correspondent.  PTAs used for illegal purposes can cause banks serious financial losses in criminal and civil fines and penalties, 
seizure or forfeiture of collateral, and reputation damage. 
Risk Mitigation  
U.S. banks offering PTA services should develop and maintain adequate policies, 
procedures, and processes to guard against possible illicit use of these accounts.  At a minimum, policies, procedures, and processes should enable each U.S. bank to identify the ultimate users of its foreign financial institution PTA and should include th e bank ’s obtaining 
(or having the ability to obtain through a trusted third- party arrangement) substantially the 
same information on the ultimate PTA users as it obtains on its direct customers.  
Policies, procedures, and processes should include a review o f the foreign financial 
institution ’s processes for identifying and monitoring the transactions of subaccountholders 
and for complying with any AML statutory and regulatory requirements existing in the host country and the foreign financial institution’ s master agreement with the U.S. bank .  In 
addition, U.S. banks should have procedures for monitoring transactions conducted in foreign 
financial institutions ’ PTAs.  
In an effort to address the risk inherent in PTAs, U.S. banks should have a signed contract (i.e., master agreement) that includes: 
•Roles and responsibilities of each party.
•Limits or restrictions on transaction types and amounts (e.g., currency deposits, funds
transfers, check cashing).
•Restrictions on types of subaccountholders (e.g., casas de c ambio , finance companies,
funds remitters, or other nonbank financial institutions).
•Prohibitions or restrictions on multi- tier sub accountholders.
193
•Ac
cess to the foreign financial institution ’s internal documents and audits that pertain to
its PTA activity .
U.S. banks should consider closing the PTA in the following circumstances: 
•Insufficient information on the ultimate PTA users.
•Evidence of substantive or ongoing suspicious activity.
•Inability to ensure that the PTAs are not being used for money launderi ng or other illicit
purposes.
193 It is possible for a subaccount to be subdivided into further subaccounts for separate persons.

Payable Through Accounts — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  196 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Payable Through Accounts  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
payable through accounts (PTA), and management’ s ability to implement effective 
monitoring and reporting systems. 
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to PTAs.  Evaluate the adequacy
of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’ s PTA activities and the risks
they present.  Assess whether the  controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank
from money laundering and terrorist financing.  Determine whether:
•Criteria for opening PTA relationships with a foreign financial institution are
adequate.  Examples o f factors that may be used include: jurisdiction; bank secrecy or
money laundering haven; products, services, and markets; purpose; anticipatedactivity; customer history; ownership; senior management; certificate ofincorporation; banking license; certificate of good standing; and demonstration of the
foreign financial institution ’s operational capability to monitor account activity.
•Appropriate information has been obtained and validated from the foreign financial
institution concerning the identity of any persons having authority to direct
transactions through the PTA.
•Information and EDD  have been obtained from the foreign financial institution
concerning the source and beneficial ownership of funds of persons who have
authority to direct transactions through the PTA (e.g., name, address, expected
activity level, place of employment, description of business, related accounts,identification of foreign politically exposed persons, source of funds, and articles of
incorporation).
•Subaccounts are not opened before the U.S. bank has reviewed and approved the
customer information.
•Master or sub accounts can be closed if the information provided to the bank has been
materially inaccurate or incomplete.
•The bank can identify all signers on each subaccount.
2.From a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors PTAs .
3.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring PTAs  for suspicious activities, and
reporting suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’s size, complexity, location,
and types of customer relationships.
4.To assess the volume of risk and determine whether adequate resources are allocated to
the oversight and monitoring activity, obtain a list of foreign correspondent bank
accounts in which PTAs are offered and request MIS reports that show:
•The number of sub accounts within each PTA.
--- Page 202 ---
Payable Through Accounts — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  197 2/27/2015.V2  •The volume and dollar amount of monthly transactions for each subaccount.
5. Verify that the bank has obtained and reviewed information concerning the foreign
financial institution ’s home country AML regulatory requirements (e.g., customer
identification requirements and suspicious activity reporting) and considered these
requirements when reviewing PTAs.  Determine whether the bank has ensured t hat
subaccount agreements comply with any AML statutory and regulatory requirements
existing in the foreign financial institution ’s home country.
6. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
7. On the basis of the bank’ s risk assessment of its PTA activities, as well as prior
examination and audit reports, select a sample of PTAs .  From the sample, review the
contracts or agreements with the foreign financial ins titution .  Determine whether the
contracts or agreements:
•Clearly outline the contractual responsibilities of both the U.S. bank and the foreign
financial institution.
•Define PTA and subaccount opening procedures and require an independent reviewand approval process when opening the account.
•Require the foreign financial institution to comply with its local AML requirements.
•Restrict sub accounts from being opened by casas de cambio, finance companies,
funds remitters, or other nonbank financial institutions.
•Prohibit multi- tier sub accountholders.
•Provide for proper controls over currency deposits and withdrawals bysubaccountholders and ensure that CTRs  have been appropriately filed.
•Provide for dollar limits on each subaccountholder’ s transactions that are  consistent
with expected account activity.
•Contain documentation requirements that are consistent with those used for openingdomestic accounts at the U.S. bank.
•Provide the U.S. bank with the ability to review information concerning the identity
of subaccountholders (e.g., directly or through a trusted third party).
•Require the foreign finan cial institution to monitor sub account activities for unusual
or suspicious activity and report findings to the U.S. bank.
•Allow the U.S. bank, as permitted by local laws, to audit the foreign financialinstitution ’s PTA operations and to access PTA documents.
8.Review PTA master -account bank statements.  (The examiner should determine the time
period based upon the size and complexity of the bank.) The statements chos en should
include frequent transactions and those of large dollar amounts.  Verify the statements to

made at the U.S. bank on behalf of an individual subaccountholder for credit to the 
customer ’s sub account. 
9. From the s ample selected, review each sub accountholder’s identifying information and
related transactions for a period of time as determined by the examiner .  Evaluate PTA
subaccountholders’ transactions .  Determine whether the transactions are consistent with
expected transactions or warrant further research .  (The sample should include
subaccountholders with significant dollar activity.)

Pouch Activities — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  199 2/27/2015.V2  Pouch Activities — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’ s systems to manage the risks associated with 
pouch activities, and management’s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting 
systems.  
Pouch activity entails the use of a carrier, courier (either independent or common), or a 
referral agent employed by the co urier,194 to transport currency, monetary instruments, and 
other documents from outside the United States to a bank in the United States.195 Pouches 
can be sent by another bank or individuals.  Pouch services are commonly offered in conjunction with foreign correspondent banking services.  Pouches can contain loan payments, transactions for demand deposit accounts, or other types of transactions.  Increasingly, some banks are using Remote Deposit Capture (RDC) (a deposit transaction delivery system) to replace pouch activities .  For additional information on RDC, refer to the 
expanded overview section on Electronic Banking on page 202. 
Risk Factors  
Banks should be aware that bulk amounts of monetary instruments purchased in the United States that appear to have been structured to avoid the BSA-reporting requirements often 
have been found in pouches or cash letters received from foreign financial institutions.  This is especially true in the case of pouches and cash letters received from jurisdictions with lax or deficient AML structures .  The monetary instruments involved are frequently money 
orders, traveler ’s checks, and bank checks that usually have one or more of the following 
characteristics in common: 
•The instruments were purchased on the same or consecutive days at different locations.
•They are numbered consecutively in amounts just under $3,000 or $10,000.
•The payee lines are left blank or made out to the same person (or to only a few people).
•They contain little or no purchaser information.
•They bear the s ame stamp, symbol, or initials.
•They are purchased in round denominations or repetitive amounts.
•The depositing of the instruments is followed soon after by a funds transfer out in the
same dollar amount.
Risk Mitigation  
Banks should have policies, procedures, and processes related to pouch activity that should: 
194 Referral agents are foreign individuals or corporations, contractually obligated to the U.S. bank.  They 
provide representative -type services to the bank’s clients abroad for a fee.  Services can range from referring 
new customers to the bank, to special mail handling, obtaining and pouching documents, distributing the bank’s 
brochures and applications or forms, notarizing documents for customers, and mailing customers’ funds to the bank in the  United States for deposit.  
195 For additional guidance, refer to the core overview section, “International Transportation of Currency or 
Monetary Instruments Reporting,” on page  139.

monetary instruments).
•Detail procedures for processing the pou ch, including employee responsibilities, dual
control, reconciliation and documentation requirements, and employee sign off.
•Detail procedures for reviewing for unusual or suspicious activity, including elevating
concerns to management .  (Contents of pouches may be subject to CTR, Report of
International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (CMIR), and SAR
reporting requirements.)

Pouch Activities 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’ s systems to manage the risks associated with 
pouch activities, and management’s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting 
systems.  
1. Determine whether the bank has incoming or outgoing pouch activity and whether the
activity is via carrier or  courier.
2.Review the policies, procedures, and processes, and any contractual agreements related to
pouch activities.  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes giventhe bank’s pouch activities and the risks they present.  Assess whether the controls are
adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and terrorist financing.
3.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors pouch activities.
4. D etermine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring pouch activities for suspicious
activities, and for reporting suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’ s size,
complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
5. Review the list of bank customers permitted to use pouch services (incoming and
outgoing).  Determine whether management has assessed the risk of the customers
permitted to use this service.
6. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
7. On the basis of the bank’ s  risk assessment of its pouch activities, as well as prior
examination and audit reports, and recent activity records, select a sample of daily
pouches for review.  Preferably  on an unannounced basis and over a period of several
days, not necessarily consecutive, observe the pouch opening and the data captureprocess for items contained in a sample of incoming pouches, and observe the preparationof outgoing pouches.  Review th e records and the pouch contents for currency, monetary
instruments,
196 bearer securities, prepaid  cards, gems, art, illegal substances or
contraband, or other items that should not ordinarily appear in a bank’s pouch.
8.If the courier, or the referral agen t who works for the courier, has an account with the
bank, review an appropriate sample of their account activity.
9. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated with
pouch activity.

Electronic Banking — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  202 2/27/2015.V2  Electronic Banking — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
electronic banking (e- banking) customers, including Remote Deposit Capture (RDC) activity, 
and management’ s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting systems.  
E-banking systems, which provide electronic delivery of banking products to customers, include automated teller machine (ATM) transactions; online account opening; Internet 
banking transactions; and telephone banking.  For example, credit cards, deposit accounts, mortgage loans, and funds tra nsfers can all be initiated online, without face- to-face contact .  
Management needs to recognize this as a potentially higher -risk area and develop adequate 
policies, procedures, and processes for customer identification and monitoring for specific areas o f banking.  Refer to the core examination procedures, “ Customer Identification 
Program ” (CIP) , page 53, for further guidance .  Additional information on e-banking is 
available in the FFIEC  Information Technology Examination Handbook .
197 
Risk Factors  
Banks should ensure that their monitoring systems adequately capture transactions conducted electronically .  As with any account, they should be alert to anomalies in account behavior.  
Red flags may include the velocity of funds in the account or, in the case of ATMs, the 
number of debit cards associated with the account. 
Accounts that are opened without face- to-face contact may be a higher risk for money 
laundering and terrorist financing for the following reasons: 
•More difficult to positively verify the individual’ s identity.
•Customer may be out of the bank’ s targeted geographic area or country.
•Customer may perceive the transactions as less transparent.
•Transactions are instantaneous.
•May be used by a “front ” company or unknown third party.
Risk Mitigation  
Banks should establish BSA/AML monitoring, identification, and reporting for unusual and 
suspicious activities occurring through e-banking systems.  Useful MIS for detecting unusual 
activity in higher-risk accounts include ATM activity reports, funds transfer reports, new 
account activity reports, change of Internet address reports, Internet Protocol (IP) address 
reports, and reports to identify related or linked accounts (e.g., common addresses, phone numbers, e- mail addresses, and taxpayer identification num bers).  In determining the level of 
monitoring required for an account, banks should include how the account was opened as a factor .  Banks engaging in transactional Internet banking should have effective and reliable 
methods to authenticate a customer’ s identity when opening accounts online and should 
establish policies for when a customer should be required to open accounts on a face- to-face 
197 Refer to t he FFIEC  Information Technology Examination Handbook . 
--- Page 208 ---
Electronic Banking — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  203 2/27/2015.V2  basis.198  Banks may also institute other controls, such as establishing transaction dollar 
limits for large items that require manual intervention to exceed the preset limit.  
Remote Deposit Capture  
Remote Deposit Capture (RDC) is a deposit transaction delivery system that has made check 
and monetary instrument processing (e.g., traveler’s checks or money orders) more efficient .  
In broad terms, RDC allows  a bank’s customers to scan a check or monetary instrument, and 
then transmit the scan ned or digitized image to the institution .  Scanning and transmission 
activities occur at remote locations that include  the bank’s branches, ATMs, domestic and 
foreign correspondents, and locations owned or controlled by commercial or retail customers.  
By eliminating  face- to-face transactions, RDC decreases  the cost and volume of paper 
associated with physically mailing or depositing items .  RDC also supports new and existing 
banking products and improves customers’ access to their deposits.  
On January 14, 2009, the FFIEC published guidance titled, “Risk Management of Remote Deposit Capture.” The guidance addresses the essential compo nents of RDC risk 
management: the identification, asses sment , and mitigation of risk .  It includes a 
comprehensive discussion of RDC risk factors and mitigants.  Refer to the FFIEC Web site
.  
Risk Factors  
RDC may expose banks to various risks, including money laundering, fraud, and information security.  Fraudulent, sequentially numbered, or physically altered documents, particularly 
money orders and traveler’s checks, may be more difficult to detect when submitted by RDC 
and not inspected by a qualified person.  Banks may face challenges in controlling  or 
knowing the location of RDC equipment, because  the equipment can be readily transported 
from one jurisdiction to another.  This challenge is increased as foreign correspondents and 
foreign money services businesses are increasingly using RDC services to replace pouch and certain instrument processing and clearing activities .  Inadequate controls could result in 
intentional or unintentional a lterations to deposit item data, resubmission  of a data file, or 
duplicate presentment of checks and images at one or multiple financial institutions.  In addition, original deposit items are not typically forwarded to banks, but instead the customer or the customer’s service provider retains them .  As a result, record  keeping, data safety, and 
integrity issues may increase.  
Higher -risk customers may be defined by industry, incidence of fraud, or other criteria.  
Examples of higher-risk parties include onli ne payment processors, certain credit -repair 
services, certain mail order and telephone order companies, online gambling operations, 
businesses located offshore, and adult entertainment businesses. 
Risk Mitigation 
Management should develop appropriate poli cies, procedures, and processes to mitigate the 
risks associated with RDC services and to effectively monitor for unusual or suspicious activity .  Examples of risk mitigants include :

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  204 2/27/2015.V2  •Comprehensively identifying and assessing RDC risk prior to implementatio n.  Senior
management should identify BSA/AML, operational, information security, compliance,
legal, and reputation risks.  Depending on the bank’s size and complexity, thiscomprehensive risk assessment process should include staff from BSA/AML, informationtechnology and security, deposit operations, treasury or cash management sales, business
continuity, audit, compliance, accounting and legal.
•Conducting appropriate customer CDD and EDD.
•Creating risk-based parameters  that can be used to conduct RDC customer suitability
reviews .  Parameters  may include a list of acceptable industries , standardized
underwriting criteria (e.g., credit history, financial statements, and ownership structure of
business), and other risk factors (customer’s risk mana gement processes, geographic
location, and customer base).  When the level of risk warrants, bank staff should consider
visiting the customer’s physical location as part of the suitability review .  During these
visits, the customer’s operational controls and risk management processes should be
evaluated .
•Conducting vendor due diligence when banks use a service provider for RDC activities.Management should ensure implementation of sound vendor management processes.
•Obtain ing expected account activity from the RDC customer, such as the anticipated
RDC transaction  volume, dollar volume, and type (e.g., payroll checks, third- party
checks, or traveler ’s checks), comparing it to actual activity, and re solving significant
deviations.  Comparing expected activity to business type to ensure they are reasonableand consistent.
•Establishing or modifying customer RDC transaction limits.
•Developing well -constructed contracts that clearly identify each party’s role,
responsibilities, and l iabilities, and that detail record -retention procedures for RDC data.
These procedures should include physical and logical security expectations for access,
transmission, storage, and ultimate disposal of original documents.  The contract shouldalso address the customer’s responsibility for properly securing RDC equipment andpreventing inappropriate use, including establishing effective equipment security controls(e.g., passwords, dual control access).  In addition, contracts should detail the RDCcusto mer’s obligation to provide original documents to the bank in order to facilitate
investigations related to unusual transactions or poor quality transmissions, or to resolvedisputes.  Contracts should clearly detail the authority of the bank to mandate specific
internal controls, conduct audits, or terminate the RDC relationship.
•Implementing additional monitoring or review when significant changes occur in the type
or volume of transactions, or when significant changes occur in the underwriting criteria,
customer base, customer risk management processes, or geographic location  that the bank
relied on when establishing  RDC services.
•Ensuring that RDC customers receive adequate training .  The training should include
documentation that addresses issues such as routine operations and procedures, duplicate
presentment, and problem resolution.

•As appropriate, using technology to minimize errors (e.g., the use of franking to stamp or
identify a deposit as being processed) .199
199 Franking involves printing or stamping such phrases as “Processed” or “Electronically Processed” on the 
front of the original check.  This process is used as an indicator that the paper check has already been 
electronically processed, and, therefore, should not be subsequently physically deposited.

1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to e-banking, including RDC
activity as appropriate.  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processesgiven the bank’ s e-banking activities and the risks they present.  Assess whether the
controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and terrorist
financing.
2.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors higher- risk e -banking activities.
3.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring e-banking, including RDC activity
as appropriate, for suspicious activities, and for reporting suspicious activities, isadequate given the bank ’s size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
4. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
5. On the basis of the bank’ s risk assessment of its e -banking activities, as well as prior
examination and audit reports, select a sample of e-banking accounts.  From the sampleselected , perform the following procedures:
•Review account opening documentation, including CIP, ongoing CDD , and
transaction history.
•Compare expected activity with actual activity.
•Determine whether the activity is consistent with the nature of the customer ’s
business.  Identify any  unusual or suspicious activity.
6. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated with e-banking relationships.

Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
funds transfers, and management’s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting systems .  This section expands the core review of the statutory and regulatory requirements 
of funds transfers to provide a broader assessment of AML risks associated with this activity. 
Payment systems in the United States consist of numerous financial intermediaries, f inancial 
services firms, and nonbank businesses that create, process, and distribute payments.  The 
domestic and international expansion of the banking industry and nonbank financial services has increased the importance of electronic funds transfers, including funds transfers made through the wholesale payment systems.  Additional information on the types of wholesale payment systems is available in the FFIEC  Information Technology Examination 
Handbook.

Funds Transfer Services  
The vast majority of the value of U.S. dollar payments , or transfers,  in the United States is  
ultimately processed through wholesale payment systems, which generally handle large-value transactions between banks.  Banks conduct these transfers on their own behalf as well as for the b enefit of other financial service providers and bank customers, both corporate and 
consumer. 
Related  retail transfer systems facilitate transactions such as  automated clearing houses 
(ACH ); automated teller machine s (ATM ); point-of- sales (POS );, telephone bill paying ; 
home banking systems; and credit, debit, and prepaid  cards .  Most of these retail transactions 
are initiated by customers rather than by banks or corporate users .  These individual 
transactions may then be batched in order to form l arger wholesale transfers, which are the 
focus of this section. 
The two primary domestic wholesale payment systems for interbank  funds transfers are the 
Fedwire Funds Service (Fedwire
®)201 and the Clearing House Interbank Payments System 
(CHIPS).202 The bulk of the dollar value of these payments is originated electronically to 
make large value, time- critical payments, such as the settlement of interbank purchases and 
sales of federal funds, settlement of foreign exchange transactions, disburse ment  or 
repayment  of loans; settle ment of real estate transactions or other financial market 
transactions; and purchasing , sell ing, or financ ing securities transactions .  Fedwire and 
CHIPS participants facilitate these transactions on their behalf and on behalf of their 
customers, including nonbank financial institutions, commercial businesses, and 
correspondent banks that do not have direct access. Structurally , there are two components to funds transfers: t he instruction s, which contain 
information on the sender and receiver of the funds, and the actual movement or transfer of 
200 Refer to the  FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook . 
201 Fedwire Services  is a registered service mark of the Federal Reserve Banks.  
202 CHIPS is a private multilateral settlement system owned and operated by The Clearing House Payments Co., 
LLC.

Funds Transfers — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  208 2/27/2015.V2  funds.  The instructions may be  sent in a variety of ways, including by electronic access to 
networks operated by the Fedwire or CHIPS payment systems; by access to financial 
telecommunications systems, such as Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial 
Telecommunication (SW IFT); or e -mail, facsimile, telephone, or telex.  Fedwire and CHIPS 
are used to facilitate  U.S. dollar transfers between two domestic endpoints or the U.S. dollar 
segment  of in ternational transactions .  SWIFT is an international messaging service that is 
used to transmit payment instructions for the vast majority of international interbank 
transactions, which can be denominated in numerous currencies. 
Fedwire  
Fedwire  is operated  by the Federal Reserve Banks  and allows a  participant to transfer funds 
from its master a ccount at the Federal Reserve Banks to the master account of any other 
bank.203 Payment over Fedwire is final and irrevocable when the Federal Reserve Bank either 
credi ts the amount of the payment order to the receiving bank’s Federal Reserve Bank master 
account or sends notice to the receiving bank, whichever is earlier.  Although there is no 
settlement risk to Fedwire participants, they may be exposed to  other risk s, such as  errors , 
omissions, and fraud. 
Participants  may access Fedwire by three methods: 
•Direct mainframe -to-mainframe ( Fedline Direct ).
•Internet access over a virtual private network to W eb-based applications (FedLine
Advantage).
•Off-line or telephone- based  access to a Federal Reserve Bank operations site.
CHIPS 
CHIPS is a privately operated, real -time, multilateral payments system typically used for 
large- dollar payments .  CHIPS is owned by banks, and any banking organization with a 
regulated U.S. presence may become a participant in the system .  Banks use CHIPS for the 
settlement of both interbank and customer transactions, including, for example, payments 
associated with commercial transactions, bank loans, and securities transactions.  CHIPS also plays a large role in the settlement of USD payments related to international transactions, 
such as foreign exchange, international commercial transactions, and offshore investments. 
203 An entity eligible to maintain a master account at the Federal Reserve is generally eligible to participate in 
the Fedwire Funds Service.  Thes e participants include:  
•Depository institutions.
•U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks.
•Member banks of the Federal Reserve System.
•The U.S.  Treasury and any entity specifically authorized by federal statute to use the Federal Reserv e
B
anks as fiscal agents or depositories.
•Entities designated by the Secretary of the Treasury.
•Foreign central banks, foreign monetary authorities, foreign gover nments, and certain internationa l
o
rganizations.
•Any other entity authorized by a Federal Reserve Bank to use the Fedwire Funds Service.

Funds Transfers — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  209 2/27/2015.V2  Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) Bank 
CLS Bank is a private- sector , special -purpose bank that settles simultaneously both payment 
obligations that arise from a single foreign exchange transaction .  The CLS payment- versus -
payment settlement model ensures that one payment segment  of a foreign exchange 
transaction is settled if and o nly if the corresponding payment segment  is also settled, 
eliminating the foreign exchange settlement risk that arises when each segment of the foreign 
exchange transaction is settled separately .  CLS is owned by global financial institutions 
through share holdings in CLS Group Holdings AG, a Swiss company that is the ultimate 
holding company for CLS Bank.  CLS Bank currently settles payment instructions for 
foreign exchange transactions in 17 currencies  and is expected to add more currencies over 
time.  
SWIF T 
The SWIFT network is a messaging infrastructure, not a payments system, which  provides 
users with a private international communications link among themselves .  The actual funds 
movements (payments) are completed through correspondent bank relationships, Fedwire, or CHIPS .  Movement of payments denominated in different  currencies occurs  through 
correspondent bank relationships or over funds transfer systems in the relevant country.  In 
addition to customer and bank funds transfers, SWIFT is used to transmit foreign exchange confirmations, debit and credit entry confirmations, statements, collections, and documentary 
credits.  
Cover Payments  
A typical funds transfer involves an originator instructing its bank (the originator’s bank) to 
make payment to the account of a payee (the beneficiary) with the beneficiary’s bank .  A 
cover payment occurs when the originator’s bank and the beneficiary’s bank do not have a relationship that allows them to settle the payment directly .  In that case, the originator’s 
bank instructs the beneficiary’s bank to effect the payment and advises that transmission of funds to “cover” the obligation created by the payment order has been arranged through 
correspondent accounts at one or more intermediary banks. 
Cross -border cover  payments usually involve multiple banks in multiple jurisdictions .  For 
U.S. dollar transactions, the intermediary banks are generally U.S. banks that maintain 
correspondent banking relationships with non-U.S. originators’ banks and beneficiaries’ banks.  In the past, SWIFT message protocols allowed cross-border cover payments to be 
effected by the use of separate, simultaneous message formats :  
•The MT 103 — payment order from the originator’s bank to the beneficiary’s bank with
information identifying the  origi nator and the beneficiary; and
•The MT 202 — bank- to-bank payment orders directing the intermediary banks to “cover”
the originator’s bank’s obligation to pay the beneficiary’s bank.
To address transparency concerns, SWIFT adopted a new message format for cover payments (the MT 202 COV) that contains mandatory fields for originator and beneficiary information .  Effective November 21, 2009, the MT 202 COV is required for any bank- to-
bank payment for which there is an associated MT 103.  The MT 202 COV provides 
--- Page 215 ---
Funds Transfers — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  210 2/27/2015.V2  intermediary banks with additional originator and beneficiary information to perform 
sanctions screening and suspicious activity monitoring.  The introduction of the MT 202 
COV does not alter a U.S. bank’s OFAC or BSA/AML obligations. 
The MT 202 format remains available for bank -to-bank funds transfers that have no 
associated MT 103 message.  For additional detail about transparency in cover payments, 
refer to Transparency and Compliance for U.S. Banking Organizations Conducting Cross-
Border Funds T ransfers (December 18 , 2009), which can be found at each federal banking 
agencies’ Web site. 
Informal Value Transfer Systems  
An informal value transfer system (IVTS) (e.g., hawalas) is  a term used to describe a 
currency or value transfer system that operates informally to transfer money as a business.204  
In countries lacking a stable financial sector or with large areas not served by formal banks, IVTS may be the only method for conducting financial transactions.  Persons living in the 
United States may also use IVTS to transfer funds to their home countries. 
IVTS may legally operate in the United States as a Money Services Business, and 
specifically as a type of money transmitter, so long as they abide by applica ble state and 
federal laws.  This includes registering with FinCEN and complying with BSA/AML 
provisions applicable to all money transmitters .  A more sophisticated form of IVTS 
operating in the United States often interacts with other financial institutio ns in storing 
currency, clearing checks, remitting and receiving funds, and obtaining other routine 
financial services, rather than acting independently of the formal financial system.  
Payable Upon Proper I dentification  Transactions 
One type of funds transfer transaction that carries particular risk is the payable upon proper 
identification (PUPID) service .  PUPID transactions are funds transfers for which there is no 
specific account to deposit the funds into and the beneficiary of the funds is not a bank customer .  For example, an individual may transfer funds to a relative or an individual who 
does not have an account relationship with the bank that receives the funds transfer .  In this 
case, the beneficiary bank may place the incoming funds into a suspense account and ultimately release the funds when the individual provides proof of identity.  In some cases, 
banks permit noncustomers to initiate PUPID transactions .  These transactions are considered 
extremely high risk and require strong controls. 
204 Sources of information on IVTS include:

Funds Transfers — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  211 2/27/2015.V2  Risk Factors 
Funds transfers may present a heightened degree of risk, depending on such factors as the 
number and dollar volume of transactions, geographic location of originators and beneficiaries, and whether the originator or beneficiary is a bank customer.  The size and complexity of a bank’s operation and the origin and destination of the funds being transferred determine which type of funds transfer system the bank uses.  The vast majority of funds transfer instructions are conducted electronically; however, examiners need to be mindful 
that physical instructions may be transmitted by other informal methods, as described earlier.  
Cover payments effected through SWIFT pose additional risks for an intermediary bank that 
does not receive either a MT 103 or an adequately completed MT 202 COV that identifies the originator and beneficiary of the funds transfer.  Without this data, the intermediary bank 
is unable to monitor or filter  payment information.  This lack of transparency limits the U.S. 
intermediary bank’s ability to appropriately assess and manage the risk associated with correspondent and clearing operations, monitor for suspicious activity, and screen for OFAC 
compliance.  
IVTS pose a heightened concern because they are able to circumvent the formal system .  The 
lack of recordkeeping requirements coupled with the lack of identification of the IVTS 
participants may attract money launderers and terrorists .  IVTS also pose heightened 
BSA/AML concerns because they can evade internal controls and monitoring oversight established in the formal banking environment.  Principals that operate IVTS frequently use 
banks to settle accounts. 
The risks of PUPID transactions to the beneficiary bank are similar to other activities in 
which the bank does business with noncustomers .  However, the risks are heightened in 
PUPID transactio ns if the bank allows a noncustomer to access the funds transfer system by 
providing minimal or no identifying information .  Banks that allow noncustomers to transfer 
funds using the PUPID service pose significant risk to both the originating and beneficiary banks.  In these situations, both banks have minimal or no identifying information on the 
originator or the beneficiary.  
Risk Mitigation  
Funds transfers can be used in the placement, layering, and integration stages of money 
laundering.  Funds transfers purchased with currency are an example of the placement stage.  Detecting unusual activity in the layering and integration stages is more difficult for a bank  
because transactions may appear legitimate .  In many cases, a bank may not be involved in 
the placement of the funds or in the final integration, only the layering of transactions.  Banks should consider all three stages of money laundering when evaluating or assessing funds 
transfer ris ks. 
Banks need to have sound policies, procedures, and processes to manage the BSA/AML risks 
of its funds transfer activities .  Such policies may encompass more than regulatory 
recordkeeping minimums and be expanded to cover OFAC obligations.  Funds transfer policies, procedures, and processes should address all foreign correspondent banking activities, including transactions in which U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks are 
intermediaries for their head offices.  
--- Page 217 ---
Funds Transfers — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  212 2/27/2015.V2  Obtaining CDD information is an  important risk mitigation step in providing funds transfer 
services .  Because of the nature of funds transfers, adequate and effective CDD policies, 
procedures, and processes are critical in detecting unusual and suspicious activities.  An 
effective risk-based suspicious activity monitoring and reporting system is equally important.  
Whether this monitoring and reporting system is automated or manual, it should be sufficient 
to detect suspicious trends and patterns typically associated with money laundering. 
Institutions should have processes for managing correspondent banking relationships in 
accordance with section 312 of the USA PATRIOT  Act and corresponding regulations (31 
CFR 1010.610).  Correspondent bank due diligence should take into account the 
correspondent’s practices with regard to funds transfers effected through the U.S. bank. 
U.S. banks can mitigate risk associated with cover payments by managing correspondent 
banking relationships, by observing T he Clearing House Payments Co., LLC and the 
Wolfsberg  Group’s best practices (discussed below) and the SWIFT standards when sending 
messages, and by conducting appropriate transaction screening and monitoring. 
In May 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a paper on cross- border 
cover payment messages (BIS Cover Payments Paper).205 The BIS Cover Payments P aper 
supported increased transparency and encouraged all banks involved in international 
payments transactions to adhere to the message standards developed by The Clearing House 
Payments Co., LLC and the Wolfsberg Group in 2007.  These are:  
•Financial institutions should not omit, delete , or alter information in payment messages or
orders for the purpose of avoiding detection of that information by any other financialinstitution in the payment process ;
•Financial institutions should not use any particular payment message for the purpose of
avoiding detection of information by any other financial institution in the payment
process ;
•Subject to all applicable laws, financial institutions should cooperate as fully as
practicable with other financial institutions in the payment process when requested toprovide information about the parties involved; and
•Financial institutions should strongly encourage their correspondent banks to observe
these principles.
In addition, effective monitoring processes for cover payments include: 
•Monitoring funds transfers processed through automated systems in order to identify
suspicious activity.  This monitoring may be conducted after the transfers are processed,on an automated basis, and may use a risk -based approach .  The MT 202 COV provides
intermediary banks with useful information, which can be filtered using risk factors
205 Refer to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ’s Due diligence and transparency regarding cover 
payment messages related to cross -border wire transfers .  In addition, during August 2009, the committee, 
along with the Clearinghouse Payments Co. LLC, released Q&As in order to enhance understanding of the MT 
202 COV.  
--- Page 218 ---
Funds Transfers — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  213 2/27/2015.V2  developed by the intermediary bank.  The monitoring process may be similar to that for 
MT 103 payments. 
•Given the volume of messages and data for large U.S. intermediary banks, a manual
review of every payment order may not be feasible or effective.  However, intermediary
banks should have, as part of their monitoring processes, a risk-based method to identifyincomplete fields or fields with meaningless data .  U.S. banks engaged in processing
cover payments should have policies to address such circumstances, including those that
involve systems other than SWIFT.
Originating and beneficiary banks should establish effective and appropriate policies, procedures, and processes for PUPID activity including: 
•Specifying the type of identification that is acceptable.
•Maintaining documentation of individuals consistent with the bank’s recordkeepi ng
policies.
•Defining which bank employees may conduct PUPID transactions.
•Establishing limits on the amount of funds that may be transferred to or from the bank for
noncustomers (including type of funds accepted (i.e., currency or official check) by
origi nating bank).
•Monitoring and reporting suspicious activities.
•Providing enhanced scrutiny for transfers to or from certain jurisdictions.
•Identifying disbursement method (i.e., by currency or official check) for proceeds from a
beneficiary bank.

Funds Transfers — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  214 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Funds Transfers  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
funds transfers, and management’s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting systems .  This section expands the core review of the statutory and regulatory requirements 
of funds transfers to provide a broader assessment of AML risks associated with this activity. 
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to funds trans fers.  Evaluate the
adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’ s funds transfer
activities and the risks they present.  Assess whether the controls are adequate to
reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and terrorist fina ncing.
2.Review MIS and internal risk rating factors, and determine whether the bank effectively
identifies and monitors funds transfer activities.
3.Evaluate the bank ’s risks related to funds transfer activities by analyzing the frequency
and dollar volume of funds transfers , jurisdictions, and the bank’s role in the funds
transfer process ( e.g., whether it is the originator’s bank, intermediary bank, or
beneficiary’s bank) .  These factors should be evaluated  in relation to the bank’ s size, its
location, and the nature of its customer  and correspondent account relationships.
4.Determine whether an audit trail of funds transfer activities exists .  Determine whether an
adequate separation of duties or other compensating controls are in place to ensure proper
authorization for sending and receiving funds transfers and for correcting postings to
accounts.
5.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring funds transfers and for reporting
suspicious activities is adequate given the bank’ s size, complexity, locat ion, and types of
customer relationships.  Determine whether suspicious activity monitoring and reportingsystems include:
•Funds transfers purchased with currency.
•Transactions in which the bank is acting as an intermediary.
•All SWIFT message formats, including MT 103, MT 202, and MT 202 COV.
•Transactions in which the bank is originating or receiving funds transfers from
foreign financial institutions, particularly to or from jurisdictions with strict privacy
and secrecy laws or those identified as higher  risk.
•Frequent currency deposits or funds transfers and then subsequent transfers,
particularly to a larger institution or out of the country.
6. Review the bank’s procedures for cross- border funds transfers:
•Determine whether the bank’s processes for foreign correspondent bank due
diligence, as required under section 312 of the USA PATRIOT  Act and
corresponding regulations include the review and evaluation of the transparency
practices of the bank’s correspondents who are involved in cross-border funds

Funds Transfers — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  215 2/27/2015.V2  transfe rs through the bank (for example, whether correspondents are appropriately 
utilizing the MT 202 COV message format).  
•As applicable and if not already performed, review the bank’s procedures to ensure
compliance with the Travel Rule, including appropriate use of the MT 202 COV
format.
•Assess the bank’s policies for cooperating with its correspondents when they request
the bank to provide information about parties involved in funds transfers.
•Assess the adequacy of the bank’s procedures for addressing isolate d as well as,
repeated instances where payment information received from a correspondent is
missing, manifestly meaningless or incomplete, or suspicious.
7.Determine the bank ’s procedures for payable upon proper identification (PUPID)
transactions.
•Beneficiary bank — determine how the bank disburses the proceeds (i.e., by currency
or official check).
•Originating bank — determine whether the bank allows PUPID funds transfers for
noncustomers.  If so, determine the type of funds accepted (i.e., by currency or
official check).
8. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
9. On the basis of the bank’ s risk assessment of funds transfer activities, as well as prior
examination and audit reports, select a sample of higher-risk funds transfer activities,
which may include the following:
•Funds transfers purchased with currency.
•Transactions in which the bank is acting as an intermediary, such as cover payments .
•Transactions in which the bank is originating or receiving funds transfers from
foreign financial institutions, particularly to or from jurisdictions with strict privacy
and secrecy laws or those i dentified as higher  risk.
•PUPID transactions.
10. From the sample selected, analyze funds transfers to determine whether the amounts,
frequency, and jurisdictions of origin or destination are consistent with the nature of thebusiness or occupation of the cust omer.
11. In addition, for funds transfers processed using the MT 202 and MT 202 COV message
formats, review the sample of messages to determine whether the bank has used the
appropriate message formats and has included complete originator and beneficiary
information (e.g., no missing or meaningless information).

Automated Clearing House Transactions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  217 2/27/2015.V2  Automated Clearing House Transactions — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
automated clearing house (ACH) and international ACH transactions (IAT) and 
management’s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting systems. 
The use of the ACH has grown markedly over the last several years  due  to the increased 
volume of electronic check conversion206 and one- time ACH debits, reflecting the lower cost 
of ACH processing relative to check processing.207 Check conversion transactions, as well as 
one-time ACH debits , are primarily low -dollar value, consumer transactions for the 
purchases of goods and services or the payment of consumer bills.  ACH is primarily  used 
for domestic payments, but the Federal Reserve Banks’ FedGlobal system208 can currently 
accommodate cross -border payments to several  countries around the world. 
In September 2006, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued guidanc e titled 
Automated Clearinghouse Activities — Risk Management Guidance.  The document provides 
guidance on managing the risks of ACH activity.  Banks may be exposed to a variety of risks when originating, receiving, or processing ACH transactions, or outsourcing these activities 
to a third party.
209 
ACH Payment Systems  
Traditionally, the ACH system has been used for the direct deposit of payroll and 
government benefit payments and for the direct payment of mortgages and loans.  As noted 
earlier, the ACH has b een expanding to include one-time debits and check conversion.  ACH 
transactions are payment instructions to either credit or debit a deposit account .  Examples of 
credit payment transactions include payroll direct deposit, Social Security, dividends, and interest payments .  Examples of debit transactions include mortgage, loan, insurance 
premium, and a variety of other consumer payments initiated through merchants or 
business es. 
In general, an ACH transaction is a batch -processed, value- dated, electronic f unds transfer 
between an originating and a receiving bank.  An ACH credit transaction is originated by the 
accountholder sending funds (payer), while an ACH debit transaction is originated by the 
206 In the electronic check conversion process, merchants that receive a check for payment do not collect the 
check through the check collection system, either electronically or in paper form.  Instead, merchants use the 
information on the check to initiate a type of electronic funds transfer known as an ACH debit to the check 
writer’s account.  The check is used to obtain the bank routing number, account number, check serial number, and dollar amount for  the transaction, and the check itself is not sent through the check collection system in any 
form as a payment instrument.  Merchants use electronic check conversion because it can be a more efficient way for them to obtain payment than collecting the che ck. 
207 Refer to the NACHA Web site . 
208 The Federal Reserve Banks operate FedACH, a central clearing facility for transmitting and receiving ACH 
payments, and FedGlobal, which sends cross -border ACH credits  payments to more than 35 countries around 
the world, plus debit payments to Canada only.  
209 Refer to OCC Bulletin 2006 -39, “ Automated Clearing House Activities: Risk Man agement Guidance ”

are known by the following terms: 
•Originator.  An organization or person that initiates an ACH transaction to an account
either as a debit or credit.
•Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI) .  The Originator’s depository
financial institution that forwards the ACH transaction into the national ACH network
through an ACH Operator.
•ACH Operator.  An ACH Operator processes all ACH transactions that flow between
different depository financial institutions .  An ACH Operator serves as a central clearing
facility that receives entries from the ODFIs and distributes the entries to the appropriate
Receiving Depository Financial Institution .  There are currently two ACH Operators:
FedACH and Electronic Payments Network (E PN).
•Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI).  The Receiver’s depository
institution that receives the ACH transaction from the ACH Operators and credits or
debits funds from their receivers’ accounts.
•Receiver.  An organization or person that authorizes the Originator to initiate an ACH
transaction, either as a debit or credit to an account.
•Gateway.  A financial institution, ACH Operator, or ODFI that acts as an entry or exit
point to or from the United States.  A formal declaration of status as  a Gateway is not
required .  ACH operators and ODFIs acting in the role of Gateway s have specific
warranties and obligations related to certain international entries .  A financial institution
acting as a Gateway generally may process inbound and outbound debit and credit
transactions .  ACH Operators acting as Gateway s may process outbound debit and credit
entries, but can limit inbound entries to credit entries only and reversals.
International ACH Payments  
NACHA —The Electronic Payments Association ( NACHA)  issued International ACH 
Transaction (IAT) operating rules and formats that became effective on September 18, 2009.
210 NACHA has since issued a number of modifications and refinements to their IAT 
operating rules. The IAT is a Standard Entry Class code for ACH payments that enables financial institutions to identify and monitor international ACH payments, and perform screening to ensure compliance with OFAC  requirements .  The rules require Gateway s to 
classify payments that are transmitted to or received from a financial agency
211 outside the 
territorial jurisdiction of the U nited S tates as IATs .  The classification depend s on where the 
financial agency that handles the payment transaction (movement of funds) is located and not 
the location of any other party to the transaction (e.g., the Originator or Receiver). 
Under NACHA operating rules, all U.S. financial institutions that participate in the ACH 
Network must be able to utilize the IAT format.  
210 For additional information on the IAT, refer to the NACHA Web site . 
211 “Financial agency” means an entity that is authorized by applicable law to accept deposits or is in the 
business of issuing money orders or transferring funds.

Automated Clearing House Transactions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  219 2/27/2015.V2  Definition of IAT  
An IAT is an ACH entry that is part of a payment transaction involving a financial agency’s 
office that is not located in the territorial jurisdiction of the United States .  An office of a 
financial agency is involved in the payment transaction if one or more of the following 
conditions are met: 
•Holds an account that is credited or debited as part of a payment transaction; or
•Receives funds directly from a person or makes payment directly to a person as part of a
payment transaction; or
•Serves  as an intermediary in the settlement of any part of a payment transaction.
IAT Defined Terms  
An “inbound entry” originates in another country and is transmitted to the United States.  For example, an inbound entry could be a customer’s on- line purchase f rom an overseas vendor.  
An inbound entry could also be funding for a company payroll.  Each subsequent IAT used 
for direct deposit would be an inbound IAT entry.  
An “outbound entry” originates in the United States and is transmitted to another country.  For example, IAT pension payments going from a U.S. ODFI to a U.S. RDFI in which the funds are then transferred to an account in another country would be outbound IAT entries. 
Payment Transaction Guidance  
A payment transaction is: 
•An instruction of a sender to a bank to pay, or to obtain payment of, or to cause another
bank to pay or to obtain payment of, a fixed or determinate amount of money that is to be
paid to, or obtained from, a Receiver, and
•Any and all settlements, accounting entries, or disburseme nts that are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the instruction.
Identification of IAT Parties  
The NACHA operating rules define parties as part of an IAT entry: 
•Foreign Correspondent Bank: A participating depository financial institution (DFI) that
holds deposits owned by other financial institutions and provides payment and other
services to those financial institutions.
•Foreign Gateway: A Gateway that acts as an entry point to or exit point from a foreigncountry.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  220 2/27/2015.V2  Information Available Under the IAT Format  
 Data available to banks  under the IAT format may assist banks in their OFAC, anti-money 
laundering, and monitoring efforts.212  Originator and receiver information  available to 
banks under the IAT format include: 
•Originator name and address .
•Receiver name and address .
•Originator and Receiver account numbers.
•ODFI name (inbound IAT, foreign DFI), identification number, and branch country code.
•RDFI name (outbound IAT, foreign DFI), identification number, and branch country
code.
•Country code.
•Currency code.
•Foreign Exchange indicator.
Effective March 14, 2014, a Gateway must identify within an inbound IAT entry: 
•The ultimate foreign beneficiary of the funds transfer when the proceeds from a debit
inbound IAT entry are “for further credit to” an ultimate foreign beneficiary that is other
than the Originator of the debit IAT entry, or
•The foreign party funding a credit inbound IAT entry when that party is not the
Originator of the credit IAT entry.
Refer to  www.nacha.org/c/IATIndustryInformation.cfm for more information on additional 
data available to banks under the new IAT format.  
Third-Party Service Providers  
A third -party service provider (TPSP) is an entity other than an Originator , ODFI, or RDFI 
that performs any functions on behalf of the Originator, the ODFI, or the RDFI with respect to the processing of ACH entries .  For example, a bank may hire a TPSP to conduct ACH 
activities on behalf of the bank.
213  NACHA operating rules  define TPSPs and relevant 
subsets of TPSPs that include “Third-Party Senders” and “Sending Points.”214  A third -party 
212 For convenience, this information is sometimes referred to as “Travel Rule” information, but as a technical 
matter the funds transfer recordkeeping and travel rules at 31 CFR 1010.410(f)) do not apply to ACH 
transactions and NACHA operating rules have not changed.  
213 Third -party service provider is a generic term for any business that provides services to a bank.  A third -
party payment processor is a specific type of service provider that processes payments such as checks, ACH files, or credit and debit card messages o r files.  Refer to expanded overview section, “Third -Party Payment 
Processors,” page 234, for additional guidance.  
214 When independent TPSPs contract with independent sales organizations or other third -party payment 
processors, there may be two or more laye rs between the ODFI and the Originator.  
--- Page 226 ---
Automated Clearing House Transactions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  221 2/27/2015.V2  sender  is a type of service provider that acts on behalf of an Originator (i.e., an intermediary 
between the Originator and the ODFI).  For  example, a third -party sender may be a customer 
of the bank processing ACH transactions on behalf of an Originator.  In a third- party sender 
arrangement, there is no contractual agreement between the ODFI and the Originator .  A 
sending point is defined as an entity that transmits entries to an ACH Ope rator on behalf of 
an ODFI.   
The functions of these TPSPs can include, but are not limited to, the creation of ACH files on 
behalf of the Originator or ODFI, or acting as a sending point of an ODFI (or receiving point 
on behalf of an RDFI). 
Risk Factors  
The ACH system was designed to transfer a high volume of low-dollar domestic transactions, 
which pose lower  BSA/AML risks .  Nevertheless, the ability to send high-dollar and 
international transactions through the ACH may expose banks to higher BSA/AML risks .  
Banks without a robust BSA/AML monitoring system may be exposed to additional risk 
particularly when accounts are opened over the Internet without face- to-face contact.  
ACH transaction s that are originated through a TPSP (that is, when the Originator is not a 
direct customer of the ODFI) may increase BSA/AML risks, therefore, making it difficult for 
an ODFI to underwrite and review Originator transactions for compliance with BSA/AML rules.
215 Risks are heightened when neither the TPSP nor the ODFI performs due diligence 
on the companies for whom they are originating payments. 
Certain ACH transactions, such as those originated through the Internet or the telephone, 
may be susceptible to man ipulation and fraudulent use.  Certain practices associated with 
how the banking industry processes ACH transactions may expose banks to BSA/AML risks.  
These practices include:  
•An ODFI authorizing a TPSP to send ACH files directly to an ACH Operator , in essence
bypassing the ODFI.
•ODFIs and RDFIs relying on each other to perform adequate due diligence on their
customers.
•Batch processing that obscures the identities of originators.
•Lack of sharing of information on or about originators and receivers inhibits a bank’s
ability to appropriately assess and manage the risk associated with correspondent and
ACH processing operations, monitor for suspicious activity, and screen for OFAC
compliance.
215 A bank’s underwriting policy should define what information each application should contain.  The depth of 
the review of an originator’s application should match the level of risk posed by the originator.  The 
underwriting policy should require a background check of each originator to support the validity of the 
business.

Automated Clearing House Transactions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  222 2/27/2015.V2  Risk Mitigation  
The BSA requires banks to have BSA/AML compliance programs and appropriate policies, 
procedures, and processes in place to monitor and identify unusual activity, including ACH transactions .  Obtaining CDD information  in all operations is an important mitigant of 
BSA/AML risk in ACH transactions .  Because of the nature of ACH transactions and the 
reliance that ODFIs and RDFIs place on each other for OFAC reviews and other necessary due diligence information, it is essential that all parties have a strong CDD program for regular ACH customers .  For relation ships with TPSPs, CDD on the TPSP can be 
supplemented with due diligence on the principals associated with the TPSP and, as necessary, on the originators.  Adequate and effective CDD policies, procedures, and processes are critical in detecting a pattern o f unusual and suspicious activities because the 
individual ACH transactions are typically not reviewed.  Equally important is an effective risk-based suspicious activity monitoring and reporting system.  In cases where a bank is 
heavily reliant upon the TPSP, a bank may want to review the TPSP’s suspicious activity monitoring and reporting program, either through its own or an independent inspection.  The ODFI may establish an agreement with the TPSP, which delineate s general TPSP guidelines, 
such as compliance with ACH operating requirements and responsibilities and meeting other applicable state and federal regulations .  Banks may need to consider controls to restrict or 
refuse ACH services to potential originators and receivers engaged in questionable or 
deceptive business practices.  
ACH transactions can be used in the layering and integration stages of money laundering.  Detecting unusual activity in the layering and integration stages can be a difficult task, because ACH may be used to legitimize frequent and recurring transactions .  Banks should 
consider the layering and integration stages of money laundering when evaluating or 
assessing the ACH transaction risks of a particular customer. 
The ODFI should be aware of IAT activity and evaluate the activity using a risk -based 
approach in order to ensure that suspicious activity is identified and monitored.  The ODFI, if 
frequently involved in IATs , may develop a separate process , which may be automated, for 
reviewing IATs that minimizes disruption to general ACH processing, reconcilement, and 
settlement.  
The potentially higher risk inherent in IATs should be considered in the bank’s ACH policies, procedures, and processes.  The bank should consider its current and potential roles and responsibilities when developing internal controls to monitor and mitigate the risk 
associated with IATs and to comply with the bank’s suspicious activity reporting obligations. 
In processing IATs, banks should consider the following: 
•Customers and transactions types and volume.
•Third -party payment processor relationships.
•Responsibilities, obligations, and risks of becoming a Gateway .
•CIP, CDD, and EDD standards and practices.
•Suspicious activity monitoring and reporting.
--- Page 228 ---
Automated Clearing House Transactions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  223 2/27/2015.V2  •Appropriate MIS , including the potential necessity for sys tems upgrades or changes .
•Processing procedures (e.g., identifying and handling IATs, resolving OFAC hits, and
handling noncompliant and rejected messages).
•Training programs for appropriate bank personnel (e.g., ACH personnel, operations,compliance audit, customer service, etc.) .
•Legal agreements, including those with customers, third -party processors, and vendors,
and whether those agreements need to be upgraded or modified.
OFAC Screening  
ACH transaction s may involve persons or parties that are subject to the sanctions programs 
administered by  OFAC .  (Refer to core overview section, “Office of Foreign Assets Control,” 
page 142, for additional guidance.)  OFAC has clarified its interpretation of the application of 
its rules for domestic and cross- border A CH transactions and provided more detailed 
guidance on cross- border ACH.216 
With respect to domestic ACH transactions, the ODFI is responsible for verifying that the Originator is not a blocked party and making a good faith effort to ascertain that the 
Origi nator is not transmitting blocked funds.  The RDFI similarly is responsible for verifying 
that the Receiver is not a blocked party .  In this way, the ODFI and the RDFI are relying on 
each other for compliance with OFAC regulations. 
If an ODFI receives domestic ACH transactions that its customer has already batched, the 
ODFI is not responsible for unbatching those transactions to ensure that no transactions 
violate OFAC’s regulations .  If an ODFI unbatches a file originally received from the 
Originator in order to process “on-us” transactions, that ODFI is responsible for the OFAC compliance for the on -us transactions because it is acting as both the ODFI and the RDFI for 
those transactions.  ODFIs acting in this capacity should already know their custome rs for the 
purpose of compliance with OFAC and other regulatory requirements.  For the residual 
unbatched transactions in the file that are not "on-us," as well as those situations where banks deal with unbatched ACH records for reasons other than to strip out the on-us transactions, banks should determine the level of their OFAC risk and develop appropriate policies, procedures, and processes to address the associated risks.  Such policies might involve screening each unbatched ACH record .  Similarly, banks that have relationships with TPSP 
should assess the nature of those relationships and their related ACH transactions to ascertain the bank’s level of OFAC risk and to develop appropriate policies, procedures, and processes 
to mitigate that risk.  
With res pect to cross -border screening, similar but somewhat more stringent OFAC  
screening  obligations hold for IATs .  In the case of inbound IATs, and regardless of whether 
the OFAC flag in the IAT is set, an RDFI is responsible for compliance with OFAC 
sanctions.  For outbound IATs , the ODFI should not rely on OFAC screening by an RDFI 
outside of the United States.  In these situations, the ODFI must exercise increased diligence 
to ensure that illegal transactions are not processed.  
216 Refer to Interpretive Note 041214- FACRL -GN-02. 
--- Page 229 ---
Automated Clearing House Transactions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  224 2/27/2015.V2  Due diligence for an inbound or outbound IAT may include screening the parties to a 
transaction, as well as reviewing the details of the payment field information for an indication of a sanctions violation, investigating the resulting hits, if any, and ultimately blocking or rejecting the transaction, as appropriate.  Refer to the core overview section, 
“Office of Foreign Asset Control,” page 142, for additional guidance. 
In guidance issued on March 10, 2009, OFAC authorized institutions in the United States 
when they are acting as an ODFI/ Gateway  for inbound IAT debits to reject transactions that 
appear to involve blockable property or property interests.
217 The guidance further stated that 
to the extent that an ODFI/Gateway  screens inbound IAT debits for possible OFAC 
violations prior to execution and in the course of such screening discovers a potential OFAC violation, the suspect transaction is to be removed from the batch for further investigation.  If 
the ODFI/ Gateway  determines that the transaction does appear to violate OFAC regulations, 
the ODFI/ Gateway  should refuse to process the transfer.  The procedure applies to 
transactions that would normally be blocked as well as to transactions that would normally be 
rejected for OFAC purposes based on the information in the payments. 
Addi tional information on the types of retail payment systems (ACH payment systems) is

Systems  booklet.

Automated Clearing House Transactions — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  225 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Automated Clearing House Transactions  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
automated clearing house (ACH) and international ACH transactions (IAT) and 
management’s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting systems. 
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to ACH transactions, including
IATs .  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies , procedures, and processes given the bank’ s
ACH transactions , including IATs, and the risks they present.  Assess whether the
controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and terrorist
financing.
2.From  review of MIS and int ernal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors higher-risk customers using ACH transactions,
including IATs .
3.Evaluate the bank ’s risks related to ACH transactions , including IATs, by analyzing the
frequency and  dollar volume and types of ACH transactions  in relation to the bank’ s size,
its location, the nature of its customer account relationships, and the location of the originor destination of IATs relative to the bank’s location.
4.Determine whether the ban k’s system for monitoring customers, including third -party
service providers (TPSP), using ACH transactions and IATs for suspicious activities, and
for reporting of suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’s size, complexity,
location, and types of customer relationships.  Determine whether internal control
systems include:
•Identifying customers with frequent and large ACH transactions or IATs .
•Monitoring ACH detail activity when the batch -processed transactions are separated
for other purposes (e.g., processing errors).
•As appropriate, identifying and applying i ncreased due diligence to higher- risk
customers who originate or receive IATs , particularly when a party to the transaction
is located in a higher -risk geographic location.
•Using methods to track, review, and investigate customer complaints or unauthorized
returns regarding possible fraudulent or duplicate ACH transactions, including IATs.
5. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
6. On the basis of the bank’ s risk assessment of customers with ACH transactions as well as
prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of higher -risk customers, including
TPSPs, with ACH transactions or IATs , which may include the following:
--- Page 231 ---
Automated Clearing House Transactions — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  226 2/27/2015.V2  •Customers initiating ACH transactions , including IATs, from the Internet or via
telephone, particularly from an account opened on the Internet or via the telephone
without face- to-face interaction.
•Customers whose business or occupation does not warrant the volume or nature ofACH or IAT activity.
•Customers who have been involved in the origination or receipt of duplicate or
fraudulent ACH transactions or IATs .
•Customers or originators (clients of customers) that are generating a high rate or highvolume of invalid account returns, consumer unauthorized returns, or other
unauthorized transactions.
7.From the sample selected, analyze ACH transactions , including IATs, to determine
whether the amounts, frequency, and jurisdictions of origin or destination are consistent
with the nature of the business or occupation of the customer.  A review of the accountopening documentation, including CIP documentation, may be necessary in making these
determinations .  Identify any suspicious or unusual activity.
8. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated with
ACH transactions  and IATs .

Prepaid Access — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  227 2/27/2015.V2  Prepaid Access - Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
prepaid access products, and management’s ability to implement effective monitoring and 
reporting systems.  
Prepaid access is defined as acc ess to funds or the value of funds that have been paid in 
advance and can be retrieved or transferred at some point in the future through an electronic 
device or vehicle, such as a card, code, electronic serial number, mobile identification 
number or personal identification number.218 
Banks often rely on multiple third parties to accomplish the design, implementation, and 
maintenance of their prepaid access programs.  These third parties may include program managers, distributors, marketers, merchants, and processors.  Some banks that offer prepaid access products do so as the issuing bank.  In addition to issuing prepaid access , banks may 
participate i n other aspects of a prepaid program such as marketing and distributing products 
issued by a nother financial institution.   FinCEN regulations define certain non-bank 
providers and sellers of prepaid access as money services businesses ( MSBs).   
Prepaid access can be issued in an electronic or physical form  and linked to funds held in a 
pooled account.  Consumers use both electronic and physical prepaid products to access funds held by banks in pooled accounts that are linked to subaccounts. 
The growth of prepaid access as a financial tool continues to flourish.  While prepaid cards 
are the most well -known and popular products used by consumers at this time, prepaid access 
products are continuing to evolve.  This section is intended to address prepaid card relationships as well as other type s of prepaid access.  Guidance on risk factors and risk 
mitigation for prepaid cards is based on current practice and is not intended to exclude other 
types of prepaid access.  
Prepaid Cards 
Prepaid access can cover a var iety of products, functionalities, and technologies.  Physical 
access, issued in the form of prepaid cards, is currently the most popular form and is widely 
used for payments by governments, businesses and consumers.  Most payment networks 
require that the ir branded prepaid cards be issued by a bank that is a member of that payment 
network.  Prepaid cards operate within either an “open” or “closed” loop system.  Open  loop 
prepaid cards can be used for purchases at any merchant that accepts cards issued for use on 
the payment network associated with the card and to access cash at any automated teller machine (ATM) that connects to the affiliated ATM network.  Examples of open loop 
prepaid cards include payroll cards , general purpose reloadable (GPR) cards, and certain gift 
cards.  Some prepaid cards may be reloaded, allowing the cardholder or other person (such as 
an employer) to add value.  Closed loop prepaid cards generally can only be used to buy 
goods or services from the merchant issuing the card or a select group of merchants or service providers that participate in a specific network.  Examples of closed  loop prepaid 
cards  include merchant -specific retail gift cards, mall cards, and mass transit system cards.   
218 31 CFR 1010.100(ww).  
--- Page 233 ---
Prepaid Access — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  228 2/27/2015.V2  Closed loop prepaid cards generally do not allow for cash access, although they can often be 
resold through third -party  Web sites in exchange for other closed loop cards or payment via 
check, ACH or other method. 
Prepaid cards are highly flexible and can be customized to meet the needs of the specific 
program.  Some prepaid card programs are designed for specific limited -use purposes, such 
as flexible spending account (FSA) or health savings account ( HSA ) cards that can be used to 
purchase specific health -related  services .  Some prepaid card programs are used by state and 
federal government agencies to disburse government benefits (e.g., disability, 
unemployment, etc.) or provide income tax refunds, or by employers to deliver wage and 
salary payments . 
Like debit cards, prepaid cards provide a compact and transportable way to maintain and 
access funds.  Consumers use prepaid cards in a variety of ways, such as purchasing 
products, making transfers to other cardholders within the prepaid program, and pa ying bills .  
They also offer individuals an alternative to cash and money orders.  As an alternate method 
of cross -border funds transmittal, a small number of prepaid card programs may issue 
multiple cards per account, so that persons in another country or j urisdiction can access the 
funds loaded by the original cardholder via ATM withdrawals of cash or merchant purchases.  For such programs, risk -based customer due diligence should be conducted on the original 
cardholder and transactions should be subjected to risk -based monitoring.  
Prepaid Access Participants  
Prepaid access programs often rely on multiple third parties to accomplish the design, implementation, and maintenance of their programs.  Within a prepaid access program, these 
parties are known by the following terms:  
•Program Manager.  Runs the program’s day- to-day operations.  This entity may or may
not also be the entity that creates the program and designs the features and characteristics
of the prepaid product.  May be a provider of prepaid access  (Money Services Business
(MSB) ) under FinCEN’s rule.
219
•N
etwork.  Any of the payment networks that clear, settle , and process transactions.
•Distributor.  An organization that markets and distributes prepaid products.
•Provider of Prepaid Access.  A participant within a prepaid program that agrees to serve
as the principal conduit for access to information from its fellow program participants.
The provider must register with FinCEN as an MSB and identify each prepaid programfor which it is the provider of prepaid access.  As an MSB, providers of prepaid accessare subject to certain BSA/AML responsibilities.  A bank that serves as a provider of
prepaid access has no requirement to register with FinCEN.
•Payment Processor.  The entity that tracks and manages transactions and may be
responsible for account set-up and activation; adding value to products; and fraud control
and reporting.

--- Page 234 ---
Prepaid Access — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  229 2/27/2015.V2  •Issuing Bank.  A bank that offers network branded prepaid products to consumers and
may serve as the holder of funds that have been prepaid and are awaiting instructions to
be disbursed.
•Seller or Retailer. A convenience store, drugstore, supermarket, or location where aconsumer can buy a prepaid product.
Contractual Agreements  
Each relationship that a U.S. bank has with another financial institution or third party as part 
of a prepaid access program should be governed by an agreement or a contract describing 
each party’s responsibilities and other relationship details, such as the products and services provided.  The agreement or contract should also consider each party’s BSA/AML and OFAC compliance requirements, customer base, due diligence procedures, and any payment network obligations.  The issuing bank maintains ultimate responsibility for BSA/AML 
compliance whether or not a contractual agreement has been established.  
Risk Factors  
As with other payment instruments, money laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal 
activity may occur through prepaid access and prepaid card programs if effective controls are 
not in place.  For example, law enforcement investigations h ave found that some prepaid 
holders have used false identification and funded their initial loads with stolen credit cards , 
or have purchased multiple prepaid cards under aliases.  In the placement phase of money 
laundering, because many domestic and offshore banks offer prepaid access products or 
services with currency access through ATMs internationally, criminals may load cash from 
illicit sources onto prepaid  access products and send them to accom plices inside or outside 
the United States .  Generally, domestically issued prepaid cards  can only be loaded in the 
United States .  Investigations have disclosed that both open and closed loop prepaid cards 
have been used in conjunction with, or as a replacement to, bulk cash smuggling.  Although prepaid access is increasingly regulated and is issued by highly regulated banks, some third 
parties involved in marketing or distributing prepaid access  programs may or may not be 
subject to regulatory requirements, oversight, and supervision.  In addition, these 
requirements may vary by party.  
Prepaid access  programs are extremely diverse in the range of products and services offered 
and the customer bas es they serve.  In evaluating the risk profile of a prepaid access  program, 
banks should consider the program’s specific features and functionalities.  H igher potential 
money laundering risk associated with prepaid access would result if the holder is 
anonymous, or if the holder or purchaser provides fictitious holder /purchaser  information .  
Higher risk is also associated with cash access (especially internationally), and the volume 
and velocity of funds that can be loaded or transacted.  Other risk factors  include type and 
frequency of loads and transactions, geographic location where the transaction activity  
occurs , the relationships between the bank and parties associated with the program, value 
limits, distribution channels, and the nature of funding sources.   Transactions using prepaid 
access may pose the following unique risks to the bank: 
•Funds may be transferred to or from an unknown third party.
--- Page 235 ---
Prepaid Access — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  230 2/27/2015.V2  •Verification  of cardholder identity may be done entirely remotely, relying on third -party
program managers, processors or distributors.
•As with other modes of electronic payments (e.g., ACH, wire transfer, credit and debit
cards), holders may be able to use prepaid access products internationally, thus avoiding
border restrictions and reporting requirements applicable to cash and monetary
instruments.
•Transactions may be credited or debited to the user’s payment product immediately,
although there may be a lag in delivery of funds to the issuing bank, creating a load
timing risk for the bank (also referred to as a “funds in flight” risk).
•Specific holder activity may be difficult to determine by reviewing activity through a
pooled account.
•Data in underlying pooled accounts may be held or managed by third parties, separate
from the issuing bank.
•Marketing of payment products, customer service, and onboarding of new customers
(both consumer and business customers) may be handled primarily by third partiesseparate from the issuing bank.
•The customer may perceive the transactions as less transparent.
•Source of payroll funding may come through an intermediary bank and may not betransparent.
Risk Mitigation  
Banks that offer prepaid access  or otherwise participate in prepaid access  programs should 
have policies, procedures, and processes sufficient to manage the re lated BSA/AML risks  as 
required under the BSA and implementing regulations, as well as under payment network 
rules .  Guidance provided by the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association is an additional 
resource for banks that provide prepaid card services .220  
BSA/AML ri sk mitigation is an important factor  for prepaid access programs , involving 
several key components:  
•Conducting appropriate d ue diligence on any third -party  service provider.
•Conducting a r isk assessment of the prepaid access product itself including product
features and how it is distributed and loaded.
•Monitoring transactions conducted or attempted by, at or through the bank for unusual orsuspicious activity.
•Product features and limits on usage.

Programs ,” February 28, 2008.

Prepaid Access — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  231 2/27/2015.V2  Third -Party Service Providers  
A bank’s C ustomer Due Diligence (C DD) program should provide for a risk assessment of 
all third parties involved in offering, managing, distributing, processing, or otherwise 
implementing the prepaid access  program, considering all relevant factors, including, as 
appropriate: 
•A review of such party’ s BSA/AM L compliance program.
•Systems integrity and BSA/AML monitoring capabilities.
•The policies on outsourcing should include processes for (1) documenting in writing the
roles and responsibilities of the parties, (2) ma intaining the confidentiality of customer
information, and (3) maintaining the necessary access to information.  The policies
should include the right to audit the third party to monitor its performance.
•The BSA/AML and OFAC obligations of third parties.
•On-site audits .
•Corporate documentation, licenses, references (including independent reporting services),
and, if appropriate, documentation on principal owners.
•An understanding of the third party’s overall compliance culture.
Product Features and Distribution  
Product features can provide important mitigation to the BSA/AML risks inherent in prepaid 
access and prepaid card relationships and transactions and may include:  
•Limits or prohibitions on cash loads, access, or redemption, particularly where holder
information is not on file.
•Limits or prohibitions on amounts of loads and number of loads/reloads within a specific
time frame ( load velocity limits ).
•Controls on the number of cards purchased by one individual or the number of cards thatcan access the same card account .
•Controls on the ability to transfer or co- mingle funds.
•Maximum dollar thresholds on ATM withdrawals and on the number of withdrawalswithin a specific time frame ( ATM velocity limits ).
•Maximum dollar thresholds on Point of Sale (POS) transactions for individual s and
transactions within a preset time period (i.e., daily or monthly); and on the number of
withdrawals within a specific time frame (POS velocity limits).
•Limits or prohibitions on certain usage (e.g., merchant type) and on geographic usage,
such as outside the United States.
•The ability to reverse transactions.

Prepaid Access — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  232 2/27/2015.V2  •Limits on aggregate card values.
Other features that mitigate risks in this area include: 
•The identity and location of all third parties involved in selling or distributing the prepaid
access program, including any subagents.
•The type, purpose, and anticipated activity of the prepaid access program.
Customers/ Prepaid Users  
Customer due diligence regarding the purchaser and/or the user(s) of the prepaid product can 
also be important BSA/AML risk mitigant and may include: 
•Whether the source of funds is known and trusted (such as corporate or governmentloads, vs. loads by individuals).
•The nature of the third parties’ businesses and the markets and customer bases served.
•The information collected to identify and verify the holders’ identity.
•The nature and duration of the bank’s relationship with third parties who are the source of
funds in the prepaid access program.
•The company requesting payroll funding and the source of payroll funding.
•The ability to monitor and tra ck loads, transactions and velocity.
As part of their system of internal controls, banks should establish a means for monitoring, 
identifying, and reporting suspicious activity related to prepaid access  programs .  This 
reporting obligation extends to all transactions by, at, or through the bank, including those in an aggregated form.  Banks may need to establish protocols to regularly obtain transaction information from processors or other third parties.  Monitoring systems should have the ability to identify foreign activity, bulk purchases made by one individual, and multiple purchases made by related parties.  In addition, procedures should include monitoring for 
unusual activity patterns, such as: 
•cash loads f ollowed immediately by withdrawals of the full amount from another
location , or
•multiple unrelated funds transfers onto the prepaid access product, such as in tax refund
fraud situations where multiple tax refunds are loaded onto one card.
Various manageme nt information system reports ( MIS) may be useful for detecting unusual 
activity on higher-risk accounts.  Those reports include ATM activity reports (focusing on foreign transactions), funds transfer reports, new account activity reports, change of Internet address reports, Internet Protocol (IP) address reports, and reports to identify related or linked accounts (e.g., common addresses, phone numbers, e- mail addresses, and taxpayer 
identification numbers).

Prepaid Access – Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  233 2/27/2015.V2  Examination  Procedures 
Prepaid Access  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
prepaid access, and management’s ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting 
systems.  
1.Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to prepaid access.  Evaluate the
risks posed by the prepaid access products offered, and the adequacy of the policies,procedures, and processes given  the risks such prepaid access products present.  Assesswhether the controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering
and terrorist financing.
2. Review the due diligence undertaken by the bank regarding third -party  service providers
such as program managers, processors, marketer s, merchants and distributors.  Assess
whether existing onboarding and ongoing oversight programs are reasonably satisfactoryto protect the bank.
3.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors higher- risk prepaid access transactions, such as
transactions involving unknown sources of funds (as opposed to funds received from a
long- term commercial customer or federal, state or local government entity) as well as
transactions involving int ernational cash access/ATM transactions (as opposed to
domestic merchandise -only transactions).
4.Determine whether the bank’s prepaid access program is governed by an agreement or acontract describing each party’s responsibilities and other relationship details, such as theproducts and services provided.  At a minimum, the contract should consider each
party’s:
•BSA/AML and OFAC compliance requirements;
•customer base;
•due diligence procedures; and
•network obligations.
5.Determine whether the bank’s system for monitoring prepaid access  transactions for
suspicious activities, and for reporting suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’s
size, complexity, location, customer profile, and types of prepaid access products offered .
6.If appropriate, refer  to the examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets Control,”
page 152; “Third Party Payment Processors,” page 239; and “Nonb ank Financial
Institutions,” page 307, for guidance.

Third -Party Payment Processors — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  235 2/27/2015.V2  Third-Party Payment Processors — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with its 
relationships with third -party payment processors, and management’ s ability to implement 
effective monitoring and reporting systems. 
Nonbank or third -party payment processors (processors) are bank customers that provide 
payment- processing services  to merchants and other business entities.  Traditionally, 
processors contracted primarily with retailers that had physical locations in order to process 
the retailers’ transactions .  These merchant transactions primarily included credit card 
payments but also covered automated clearing house (ACH) transactions ,221 remotely created 
checks  (RCC),222 and debit and prepaid  cards transactions .  With the expansion of the 
Internet, retail borders have been eliminated .  Processors now provide services to a variety of 
merchant accounts, including conventional retail and Internet-based establishments, prepaid 
travel, telemarketers, and Internet gaming enterprises.  
Third -party payment processors often use their commercial bank accounts to conduct 
payment processing for their merchant clients .  For example, the processor may deposit into 
its account RCCs generated on behalf of a merchant client, or process ACH transactions  on 
behalf of a merchant client .  In either case, the bank does not have a direct relationship with 
the merchant .  The increased use of RCCs by processor customers also raises the risk of 
fraudulent payments being processed through the processor’s bank account.  The Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) , Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC ), 
and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN) have issued guidance regarding the 
risks, including the BSA/AML risks, associated with banking third- party processors.223 
Risk Factors  
Processors generally are not subject to BSA/AML regulatory requirement s.  As a result, 
some processors may be vulnerable to money laundering, identity theft, fraud schemes, or 
other illicit transactions , including those prohibited by OFAC. 
The bank’s BSA/AML risks when dealing with a processor account are similar to risks from 
other activities in which the bank’s customer conducts transactions through the bank on 
221 NACHA – The Electronic Payments Association ( NACHA) is the administrator of the Automated Clearing 
House (ACH) Network. The ACH Network is governed by the NACHA Operating Rules, which provides the 
legal foundation for the exchange of ACH and IAT payments . The NACHA Web site  includes additional 
information about the ACH payment system.  
222 A remotely created check (sometimes called a “demand draft”) is a check that is not created by the paying 
bank (often created by a payee or its service provider), drawn on a customer’s bank account.  The check often is 
authorized by the customer remotely,  by telephone or online, and, therefore, does not bear the customer’s 
handwritten signature.

Third -Party Payment Processors — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  236 2/27/2015.V2  behalf of the customer’s clients .  When the bank is unable to identify and understand the 
nature and source of the transactions processed through an account, the risks to the bank and 
the likelihood of suspicious activity can increase.  If a bank has not implemented an adequate 
processor-approval program that goes beyond credit risk management, it could be vulnerable 
to processing illicit or OFAC -sanctioned transactio ns. 
Whil e payment processors generally a ffect legitimate payment transactions for reputable 
merchants, the risk profile of such entities can vary significantly depending on the make-up 
of their customer base.  Banks with third -party  payment processor customers should be aware 
of the heightened risk of returns and use of services by higher- risk merchants .  Some higher-
risk merchants routinely use third parties to process their transactions because they do not have a direct bank relati onship.  Payment processors pose greater money laundering and 
fraud risk if they do not have an effective means of verifying their merchant clients’ identities and business practices .  Risks are heightened when the processor does not perform 
adequate due d iligence on the merchants for which they are originating payments.  
Risk Mitigation  
Banks offering account services to processors should develop and maintain adequate policies, procedures, and processes to address risks related to these relationships.  At a  minimum, 
these policies should authenticate the processor’s business operations and assess their risk level .  A bank may assess the risks associated with payment processors by considering the 
following: 
•Implementing a policy that requires an initial backg round check of the processor (using ,
for example, the Federal Trade Commission  Web site, Better Business Bureau,
Nationwide M ulti-State Licensing System & Registry (NMLS), NACHA, state
incorporation departments, Internet searches, and other investigative processes) , its
principal owners, and of the processor’s underlying merchants, on a risk-adjusted basis in
order to verify their creditworthiness and general business practices.
•Reviewing the processor’s promotional materials, including its Web site, to det ermine the
target clientele .  A bank may develop policies, procedures, and processes that restrict the
types of entities for which it allow s processing services .  These restrictions should be
clearly communicated to the  processor at account opening.
•Determining whether the processor re- sells its services to a third party who may be
referred to as an “agent or provider of Independent Sales Organization (ISO)opportunities” or “gateway” arrangements.
224
•R
eviewing the processor’s policies, procedures, and processes to determine the adequacy
of its due diligence standards for new merchants.
224 Gateway arrangements are similar to an Internet service provider with excess computer storage capacity that 
sells its capacity to a third party that would then distribute computer services to various other individuals 
unknown to the provider.  The third party would be making decisions about who would be receiving the service, 
although the provider would be providing the ultimate storage capacity.  Thus, the provider bears all of the risks 
while receiving a smaller profit.  
--- Page 242 ---
Third -Party Payment Processors — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  237 2/27/2015.V2  •Requiring the processor to identify its major customers by providing information such as
the merchant’s name, princip al business activity, geographic location, and transaction
volume.
•Verifying directly, or through the processor, that the merchant is operating a legitimate
business by comparing the merchant’s identifying information against public record
databases, and fraud and bank check databases.
•Reviewing corporate documentation including independent reporting services and, if
applicable, documentation on principal owners.
•Visiting the processor’s business operations center.
•Reviewing appropriate databases to ensure that the processor and its principal owners andopera tors have not been subject to law enforcement actions.
Banks that provide account services to third -party payment processors should monitor their 
processor relationships for any significant changes in the processor’ s business strategies that 
may affect their risk profile .  Banks should periodically re- verify and update the processors’ 
profiles to ensure the risk assessment is appropriate.  Banks should ensure that their contractual agreements with payment processors provide them with access to necessary information in a timely manner.  Banks should periodically audit their third -party payment 
processing relationships; including reviewing merchant client lists and confirming that the processor is fulfilling contractual obligations to verify the legitimacy of its merchant clients 
and their business practices. 
In addition to adequate and effective account opening and due diligence procedures for 
processor accounts, management should monitor these relationships for unusual and suspicious activities .  To effectively monitor these accounts, the bank should have an 
understanding of the following processor information: 
•Merchant base.
•Merchant activities.
•Average dollar volume and number of transactions.
•“Swiping” versus “keying” volume for credit card transactions.
•Charge-back history, including rates of return for ACH debit transactions and RCCs .
•Consumer complaints or other documentation that suggest a payment processor’s
merchant clients are inappropriately obtaining personal account information and using it
to create unauthorized RCCs or ACH debits.
With respect to account monitoring, a bank should thoroughly investigate high levels of 
returns and should not accept high levels of returns on the basis that the processor has provided collateral or other security to the bank .  High levels of RCCs or ACH debits 
returned for insufficient funds or as unauthorized can be an indication of fraud or suspicious activity.  Therefore, return rate monitoring should not be limited to only unauthorized transactions, but include returns for other reasons that may warrant further review, such as unusually high rates of return for insufficient funds or other administrative reasons.  
--- Page 243 ---
Third -Party Payment Processors — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  238 2/27/2015.V2  Transactions should be monitored for patterns that may be indicative of attempts to evade 
NACHA limitations on returned entries.  For example, resubmitting a transaction under a 
different name or for slightly modified dollar amounts can be an attempt to circumvent these 
limitations  and are violations of the NACHA Rules. 225 
A bank should implement appropriate policies, procedures, and processes that address 
compliance and fraud risks .  Policies and procedures should outline the bank’s thresholds for 
returns and establish processes to mitigate risk from payment processors, as well as possible 
actions tha t can be taken against the payment processors that exceed these standards.    
If the bank determines a SAR is warranted, FinCEN has requested banks check the 
appropriate box on the SAR report to indicate the type of suspicious activity, and include the term “payment processor ,” in both the narrative and the subject occupation portions of the 
SAR.  
225 Refer to NACHA Operating Rules .

Third -Party Payment Processors — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  239 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Third-Party Payment Processors  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’ s systems to  manage the risks associated with its 
relationships with third -party payment processors, and management’ s ability to implement 
effective monitoring and reporting systems. 
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to third-party payment proc essors
(processors).  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the
bank’s processor activities and the risks they present.  Assess whether the  controls are
adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and terr orist financing.
2.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors processor relationships, particularly those that pose a
higher risk for money laundering.
3.Determine whether the ban k’s system for monitoring processor accounts for suspicious
activities, and for reporting suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’ s size,
complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
4. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
5. On the basis of the bank’ s  risk assessment of its processor activities, as well as prior
examination and audit reports, select a sample of higher- risk processor accounts.  From
the sample selected:
•Review account opening documentation and ongoing due diligence information.
•Review account statements and, as necessary, specific transaction details to determine
how expected transactions compare with actual activity.
•Determine whether actual activity is consistent with the nature of the processor ’s
stated activity.
•Assess the controls concerning identification of high rates of returns and the processin place to address compliance and fraud risks.
•Identify any unusual or suspicious activity.

Purchase and Sale of Monetary Instruments — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  240 2/27/2015.V2  Purchase and Sale of Monetary Instruments — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
monetary instruments, and management’ s ability to implement effective monitoring and 
reporting systems.  This section expands the core review of statutory and regulatory requirements for purchase and sale of monetary instruments in order to provide a broader 
assessment of the money laundering risks associated with this activity.  
Monetary instruments are products provided by banks and include cashier’ s checks, 
traveler ’s checks, and money orders.  Monetary instruments are typically purchased to pay  
for commercial or personal transactions and, in the case of traveler’ s checks, as a form o f 
stored value for future purchases. 
Risk Factors  
The purchase or exchange of monetary instruments at the placement and layering stages of 
money laundering can conceal the source of illicit proceeds .  As a result, banks have been 
major targets in launderin g operations because they provide and process monetary 
instruments through deposits.  For example, customers or noncustomers have been known to purchase monetary instruments in amounts below the $3,000 threshold to avoid having to provide adequate identifi cation .  Subsequently, monetary instruments are then placed into 
deposit accounts to circumvent the CTR  filing threshold. 
Risk Mitigation  
Banks selling monetary instruments should have appropriate policies, procedures, and 
processes in place to mitigate ri sk.  Policies should define: 
•Acceptable and unacceptable monetary instrument transactions (e.g., noncustomer
transactions, monetary instruments with blank payees, unsigned monetary instruments,
identification requirements for structured transactions, or the purchase of multiple
sequentially numbered monetary instruments for the same payee).
•Procedures for reviewing for unusual or suspicious activity, including elevating concerns
to management.
•Criteria for closing relationships or refusing to do business with noncustomers who haveconsistently or egregiously been involved in suspicious activity.

•Sales of sequentially numbered monetary instruments from the same or different
purchasers on the same day to the same payee.
•Sales of monetary instruments to the same purchaser or sales of monetary instru ments
to different purchasers made payable to the same remitter.
•Monetary instrument purchases by noncustomers.

 Brokered Deposits — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  243 2/27/2015.V2  Brokered Deposits — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
brokered deposit relationships, and management’ s ability to implement effective due 
diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems. 
The use of brokered deposits is a common funding source for many banks.  Recent  
technology developments allow brokers to provide bankers with increased access to a broad 
range of potential investors who have no relationship with the bank.  Deposits can be raised over the Internet, through certificates of deposit listing services, or through other advertising 
methods. 
Deposit brokers provide intermediary services for banks and investors.  This activity is 
considered higher risk because each deposit broker operates under its own guidelines for obtaining deposits.  The level of regulatory oversight over deposit brokers varies, as does the applicability of BSA/AML requirements directly on the deposit broker.  However, the deposit broker is subject to OFAC requirements regardless of its regulatory status.  Consequently, the deposit broker m ay not be performing adequate customer due diligence or 
OFAC screening .  For additional information refer to the core overview section, “ Office of 
Foreign Assets Control,” page 142, or “Customer Identification Program” core examination 
procedures, page  53.
227 The bank accepting brokered deposits depends on the deposit broker 
to sufficiently perform required account opening procedures and to follow applicable 
BSA/AML compliance program requirements.  
Risk Factors  
Money laundering and terrorist financing risks arise because the bank may not know the 
ultimate beneficial owners or the source of funds.  The deposit broker could represent a range of clients that may be of higher risk for money laundering and terrorist financing (e.g., 
nonresident or offshore customers, politically exposed persons (PEP), or foreign shell banks). 
Risk Mitigation  
Banks that accept deposit broker accounts or funds should develop appropriate policies, procedures, and processes that establish minimum CDD procedures for all deposit brokers providing deposits to the bank.  The level of due diligence a bank performs should be commensurate with its knowledge of the deposit broker and the deposit broker’s known 
business practices and customer base.  
In an effort to address the risk inherent in certain deposit broker relationships, banks may 
want to consider having a signed contract that sets out the roles and responsibilities of each party and restrictions on types of customers (e.g., nonresident or offshore customers, PEPs, or foreign shell banks).  Banks should conduct sufficient due diligence on deposit brokers, especially  unknown, foreign, independent, or unregulated deposit brokers.  To manage the 
BSA/AML risks associated with brokered deposits, the bank should: 
227 For the purpose of the CIP rule, in the case of brokered deposits, the “customer” is the broker that opens the 
account.  A bank does not need to look through the deposit broker’s account to determine the identity of each 
individual subaccountholder, it need only verify the identity of the named accountholder.  
--- Page 249 ---
 Brokered Deposits — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  244 2/27/2015.V2  •Determine whether the deposit broker is a legitimate business in all operating locations
where the business is conducted.
•Review the deposit broker’s business strategies, including customer markets (e.g., foreign
or domestic customers) and methods for soliciting clients.
•Determine whether the deposit broker is subject to regulatory oversight.
•Evaluate whether the deposit broker ’s BSA/AML  and OFAC policies, procedures, and
processes are adequate (e.g. , ascertain whether the deposit broker performs sufficient
CDD including CIP procedures).
•Determine whether the deposit broker screens clients for OFAC matches.
•Evaluate the adequacy of the deposit broker’ s BSA/AML  and OFAC audits and ensure
that they address compliance with applicable regulations and requirements.
Banks should take particular care in their oversight of deposit brokers who are not regulated entities and: 
•Are unknown to the bank.
•Conduct business or obtain deposits primarily in other jurisdictions.
•Use unknown or hard- to-contact businesses and banks for references.
•Provide other services that may be suspect, such as creating shell companies for foreign
clients.
•Refuse to provide requested audit and due diligence information or insist on placi ng
deposits before providing this information.
•Use technology that provides anonymity to customers.
Banks should also monitor existing deposit broker relationships for any significant changes in business strategies that may influence the broker ’s risk prof ile.  As such, banks should 
periodically re -verify and update each deposit broker’s profile to ensure an appropriate risk 
assessment.

Transaction Testing  
5. On the basis of the bank’ s  risk assessment of its brokered deposit activities, as well as
prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of higher -risk deposit broker
accounts .  When selecting a sample, examiners should consider the following:
•New relationships with deposit brokers.
•The method of generating funds (e.g., Internet brokers).
•Types of customers (e.g., nonresident or offshore customers, politically exposedpersons, or foreign shell banks).
•A deposit broker that has appeared in the bank’ s SARs.
•Subpoenas served on the bank for a particular deposit broker.
•Foreign funds providers.
•Unusual activity.
6.Review the customer due  diligence information on the deposit broker.  For deposit
brokers who are considered higher  risk (e.g., they solicit foreign funds, market via the
Internet, or are independent brokers), assess whether  the following information is
available:
•Background and references.
•Business and marketing methods.

Privately Owned Automated Teller Machines — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  247 2/27/2015.V2  Privately Owned Automated Teller Machines — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
privately  owned automated teller machines (ATM) and Independent Sales Organization 
(ISO) relationships, and management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, 
monitoring, and reporting systems.  
Privately  owned ATMs are particularly susceptible to money laundering and fraud.  
Operators of these ATMs are often included within the definition of an ISO.228 
Privately  owned ATMs are typically found in convenience stores, bars, restaurants, grocery 
stores, or check cashing establishments.  Some ISOs are large- scale operators, but many 
privately  owned ATMs are owned by the proprietors of the establishments in which they are 
located .  Most dispense currency, but some dispense only a paper receipt (scrip) that the 
customer exchanges for currency or goods.  Fees and surcharges for withdrawals, coupled with additional business generated by customer access to an ATM , make the operation of a 
privately  owned ATM profitable. 
ISOs link their ATMs to an ATM transaction network.  The ATM network routes transaction data to the customer ’s bank to debit the customer’ s account and ultimately credit the ISO ’s 
account, which could be located at a bank anywhere in the world .  Payments to the ISO’ s 
account are typically made through the automated clearing house (ACH) system .  Additional 
information on types of retail payment systems is available in the FFIEC Information 
Technology Examination Handbook .
229 
Sponsoring Bank  
Some electronic funds transfers (EFT ) or point-of- sale (POS) networks require an ISO to be 
sponsored by a member of the network (sponsoring bank).  The sponsoring bank and the ISO are subject to all network rules .  The sponsoring bank is also charged with ensuring the ISO 
abides by all network rules.  Therefore, the sponsoring bank should conduct proper due diligence on the ISO and maintain adequate documentation to ensure that the sponsored ISO 
complies with all network rules. 
Risk Factors  
Most states do not currently register, limit ownership, monitor, or examine privately owned 
ATMs or their ISOs .230 While the provider of the ATM transaction network and the 
sponsoring bank should be conducting adequate due diligence on the ISO, actual practices 
228 An ISO typically acts as an agent for merchants, including ATM owners, to process electronic transactions. 
In some cases, an ATM owner may act as its own ISO processor.  Banks may engage the services of an ISO to 
solicit merchants and privately owned ATMs; however, in many situations, ISOs contract with merchants and ATM owners without the review and approval of the clearing bank. 
229 Refer to t he FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook .

Privately Owned Automated Teller Machines — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  248 2/27/2015.V2  may vary.  Furthermore, the provider may not be aware of ATM or ISO ownership changes 
after an ATM contract has already been established .  As a result, many privately  owned 
ATMs have been involved in, or are susceptible to, money laundering schemes, identity theft, outright theft of the ATM currency, and fraud.  Consequently, privately owned ATMs and their ISOs pose increased risk and should be treated accordingly by banks doing business 
with them.  
Due diligence becomes more of a challenge when ISOs sell ATMs to, or  subcontract with, 
other companies (sub- ISOs) whose  existence may be u nknown to the sponsoring bank.  
When an ISO contracts with or sells ATMs to sub-ISOs, the sponsoring bank may not know 
who actually owns the ATM.  Accordingly, sub-ISOs may own and operate ATMs that 
remain virtually invisible to the sponsoring bank. 
Some privately  owned ATMs are managed by a vault currency servicer that provides 
armored car currency delivery, replenishes the ATM with currency, and arranges for 
insurance against theft and damage.  Many ISOs, however, manage and maintain their own 
machines, including the replenishment of currency.  Banks may also provide currency to ISOs under a lending agreement, which exposes those banks to various risks, including 
reputation and credit risk. 
Money laundering can occur through privately owned ATMs when an ATM is replenished 
with illicit currency that is subsequently withdrawn by legitimate customers .  This process 
results in ACH deposits to the ISO’s account that appear as legitimate business transactions .  
Consequently, all three phases of money laundering (placement, layering, and integration) can occur simultaneously.  Money launderers may also collude with merchants and 
previously legitimate ISOs to provide illicit currency to the ATMs at a discount. 
Risk Mitigation  
Banks should implement appropriate policies, procedures, and processes, including 
appropriate due diligence and suspicious activity monitoring, to address risks with ISO 
customers .  At a minimum, the se policies , procedures, and processes should include: 
•Appropriate risk- based due diligence on the ISO,  through a review of corporate
documentation, licenses, permits, contracts, or references.
•Review of public databases to identify potential problems or concerns with the ISO or
principal owners.
•Understanding the ISO’s  controls for currency servicing arrangements for privately
owned ATMs, including source of replenishment currency.
•Documentation of the locations of privately owned ATMs and de termination of the ISO ’s
target geographic market.
•Expected account activity, including currency withdrawals.
Because of these risks, ISO due diligence beyond the minimum CIP  requirements is 
important.  Banks should also perform due diligence on ATM owners and sub- ISOs, as 
appropriate.  This due diligence may include:

the ATM transaction provider contract.
•Review ing public databases for information on the ATM owners.
•Obtain ing the addresses of all ATM locations, ascertain ing the types of businesses in
which the ATMs are located, and identify ing targeted demographics.
•Determin ing expected ATM activity levels, including currency withdrawals.
•Ascertain ing the sources of c urrency for the ATMs by reviewing copies of armored car
contracts, lending arrangements, or any other documentation, as appropriate.
•Obtain ing information from the ISO regarding due diligence on its sub-ISO
arrangements, such as the number and location of the ATMs, transaction volume, dollar
volume, and source of replenishment currency.

Privately Owned Automated Teller Machines — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  250 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Privately Owned Automated Teller Machines  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
privately  owned automated teller machines (ATM ) and Independent Sales Organization 
(ISO ) relationships, and management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, 
monitoring, and reporting systems. 
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to privately owned ATM accounts.
Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’ s
privately  owned ATM and ISO relationships and the risk they present.  Assess whether
the controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and
terrorist financing.
2.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors privately owned ATM accounts.
3.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring privately owned ATM accounts for
suspicious activities, and for reporting suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’ s
size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
4.Determine  whether the bank sponsors network membership for ISOs.  If the bank is a
sponsoring bank, review contractual agreements with networks and the ISOs to determine
whether due diligence procedures and controls are designed to ensure that ISOs are in
compliance with network rules.
5. Determine whether the bank obtains information from the ISO regarding due diligence on
its sub -ISO arrangements.
Transaction Testing  
6. On the basis of the bank’ s risk assessment of its privately  owned ATM and ISO
relationships, as well as prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of privately
owned ATM accounts.  From the sample selected, perform the following examination
procedures:
Review the bank ’s CDD information .  Determine whether the information adequately
verifies the ISO ’s identity and describes its:
•Background.
•Source of funds.
•Anticipated activity or transaction types and levels (e.g., funds transfers).
•ATMs (size and location).
•Currency delivery arrangement, if applicable.
Review any MIS reports the bank uses to monitor ISO accounts.  Determine whether the 
flow of funds or expected activity is consistent with the CDD information.

c
urrency, maintain ATMs, or solicit me rchant locations.  If yes, review a sample of third -
party service agreements for proper due diligence and control procedures.
8. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of polici es, procedures, and processes associated with
ISOs.

Nondeposit Investment Products — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  252 2/27/2015.V2  Nondeposit Investment Products  — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
both networking and in-house nondeposit investment products (NDIP), and management’ s 
ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting systems.  
NDIP include a wide array of investment products (e.g., securities, bonds, and fixed or variable ann uities) .  Sales programs may also include cash management sweep accounts to 
retail and commercial clients; these programs are offered by the bank directly .  Banks offer 
these investments to increase fee income and provide customers with additional products and services .  The manner in which the NDIP relationship is structured and the methods with 
which the products are offered substantially affect the bank’ s BSA/AML risks and 
responsibilities.  
Networking Arrangements  
Banks typically enter into networking ar rangements with securities broker/dealers to offer 
NDIP on bank premises .  For BSA/AML purposes, under a networking arrangement, the 
customer is a customer of the broker/dealer, although the customer may also be a bank customer for other financial services .  Bank examiners recognize that the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary regulator for NDIP offerings through broker/dealers, and the agencies observe functional supervision requirements of the Gramm–Leach –Bliley Act.
231 Federal banking agencies are responsible for supervising NDIP activity 
conducted directly by the bank.  Different types of networking arrangements may include co-
branded products, dual- employee arrangements, or third -party arrangements.  
Co-Branded P roducts 
Co-branded products are offered by another company or financial services corporation232 in 
co-sponsorship with the bank.  For example, a financial services corporation tailors a mutual 
fund product for sale at a specific bank.  The product is sold exclusively at that bank and 
bears the name of both the bank and the financial services corporation. 
Because of this co -branded relationship, responsibility for BSA/AML compliance becomes 
complex .  As these accounts are not under the sole control of the bank or financial e ntity, 
responsibilities for completing CIP , CDD, and suspicious activity monitoring and reporting 
can vary .  The bank should fully understand each party’ s contractual responsibilities and 
ensure adequate control by all parties.  
231 Functional regulation limits t he circumstances in which the federal banking agencies can directly examine or 
require reports from a bank affiliate or subsidiary whose primary regulator is the SEC, the U.S. Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission, or state issuance authorities.  Federal ba nking agencies are generally limited from 
examining such an entity unless further information is needed to determine whether the banking affiliate or 
subsidiary poses a material risk to the bank, to determine compliance with a legal requirement under the f ederal 
banking agencies’ jurisdiction, or to assess the bank’s risk management system covering the functionally regulated activities.  These standards require greater reliance on the functional regulator and better cooperation among regulators.  
232 A financi al services corporation includes those entities offering NDIP, which may include investment firms, 
financial institutions, securities brokers/dealers, and insurance companies.  
--- Page 258 ---
Nondeposit Investment Products — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  253 2/27/2015.V2  Dual -Employee Arrangements  
In a dual- employee arrangement, the bank and the financial services corporation such as an 
insurance agency or a registered broker/dealer have a common (shared) employee.  The 
shared employee may conduct banking business as well as sell NDIP, or sell NDIP full- time.  
Because of this dual- employee arrangement, the bank retains responsibility over NDIP 
activities .  Even if contractual agreements establish the financial services corporation as 
being responsible for BSA/AML, the bank needs to ensure proper overs ight of its employees , 
including dual employees, and their compliance with all regulatory requirements.233 
Under some networking arrangements, registered securities sales representatives are dual employees of the bank and the broker/dealer.  When the dual employee is providing investment products and services, the broker/dealer is responsible for monitoring the registered representative’ s compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations .  When 
the dual employee is providing bank products or services, the bank has the responsibility for 
monitoring the employee ’s performance and compliance with BSA/AML.  
Third-Party Arrangements  
Third -party arrangements may involve leasing the bank’ s lobby space to a financial services 
corporation to sell NDIPs.  In this case, the third  party must clearly differentiate itself from 
the bank.  If the arrangement is appropriately implemented, third -party arrangements do not 
affect the BSA/AML compliance requirements of the bank .  As a sound practice, the bank is 
encouraged to ascertain if the financial services provider has an adequate BSA/AML compliance program as part of its due diligence.  
In-House Sales and Proprietary Products  
Unlike networking arrangements, the bank is fully responsible for in-house NDIP 
transactions completed on behalf of its customers, either with or without the benefit of an 
internal broker/dealer employee.234 In addition, the bank may also offer its own proprietary 
NDIPs, which can be created and offered by the bank, its subsidiary, or an af filiate.  
With in -house sales and proprietary products, the entire customer relationship and all 
BSA/AML risks may need to be managed by the bank, depending on how the products are sold.  Unlike a networking arrangement, in which all or some of the responsi bilities may be 
assumed by the third -party broker/dealer with in-house sales and proprietary products, the 
bank should manage all of its in-house and proprietary NDIP sales not only on a department-
wide basis, but on a firm -wide basis.  
Risk Factors  
BSA/AML  risks arise because NDIP can involve complex legal arrangements, large dollar 
amounts, and the rapid movement of funds.  NDIP portfolios managed and controlled 
directly by clients pose a greater money laundering risk than those managed by the bank or 
233 If the bank uses the reliance provision under the CIP, responsibility for CIP shifts to the third -party provider. 
Refer to core overview section, “Customer Identification Program,” page 52 , for additional information.  
234 In certain circumstances, a bank may not be considered a broker, and an employee need not register as a 
broker/d ealer.  Refer to 15 USC 78c(a)(4) for a complete list.  
--- Page 259 ---
Nondeposit Investment Products — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  254 2/27/2015.V2  by the financial services provider .  Sophisticated clients may create ownership structures to 
obscure the ultimate control and ownership of these investments.  For example, customers 
can retain a certain level of anonymity by creating Pr ivate Investment Companies (PIC ),235 
offshore trusts, or other investment entities that hide the customer’s ownership or beneficial 
interest.  
Risk Mitigation  
Management should develop risk-based policies, procedures, and processes that enable the 
bank to identify unusual account relationships and circumstances, questionable assets and sources of funds, and other potential areas of risk (e.g., offshore accounts, agency accounts, and unidentified beneficiaries).  Management should be alert to situations that need 
additional review or research.  
Networking Arrangements  
Before entering into a networking arrangement, banks should conduct an appropriate review 
of the broker/dealer.  The review should include an assessment of the broker/dealer’ s 
financial status, management experience, National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) status, reputation, and ability to fulfill its BSA/AML compliance responsibilities in regards to the bank’ s customers .  Appropriate due diligence would include a determination that the 
broker/dealer has adequate policies, procedures, and processes in place to enable the broker/dealer to meet its legal obligations .  The bank should maintain documentation on its 
due diligence of the broker/dealer .  Furthermore, detailed written contracts should address the 
BSA/AML  responsibilities, including suspicious activity monitoring and reporting, of the 
broker/dealer and its registered representatives.  
A bank may also want to mitigate risk exposure by limiting certain investment products offered to its customers.  Investment  products such as PICs, offshore trusts, or offshore hedge 
funds may involve international funds transfers or offer customers ways to obscure 
ownership interests. 
Bank management should make reasonable efforts to update due diligence information on the 
broker/dealer .  Such efforts may include a periodic review of information on the 
broker/dealer’ s compliance with its BSA/AML responsibilities, verification of the 
broker/dealer’ s record in meeting testing requirements, and a review of consumer complaints .  
Bank management is also encouraged, when possible, to review BSA/AML reports generated 
by the broker/dealer.  This review could include information on account openings, 
transactions, investment products sold, and suspicious activity monitoring and reporting. 
In-House Sales and Proprietary Products  
Bank management should assess risk on the basis of a variety of factors such as: 
•Type of NDIP purchased and the size of the transactions.
•Types and frequency of transactions.
235 Refer to expanded overview section, “Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign),” page 31 4, for additional 
guidance on PICs .

Nondeposit Investment Products — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  255 2/27/2015.V2  •Country of residence of the principals or beneficiaries, or the country of incorporation, or
the source of funds.
•Accounts and transactions that are not usual and customary for the customer or for the
bank.
For customers that management considers higher risk for money laundering and terrorist 
financing, more stringent documentation, verification, and transaction monitoring procedures 
should be established.  EDD may be appropriate in the following situations: 
•Bank is entering into a relationship with a new customer.
•Nondiscretionary accounts have a large asset size or frequent transactions.
•Customer resides in a foreign jurisdiction.
•Customer is a PIC or other corporate structure established in a higher -risk jurisdiction.
•Assets or transactions are atypical for the customer.
•Investment type, size, assets, or transactions are atypical for the bank.
•International funds transfers are conducted, particularly from offshore funding sources.
•The identities of the principals or beneficiaries in investments or relationships are
unknown or cannot be easily determined.
•Politically exposed persons (PEP)  are parties to any investments or transactions.

Nondeposit  Investment Products — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  256 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Nondeposit Investment Products  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’ s systems to manage the risks associated with 
both networking and in-house nondeposit investment products (NDIP), and management’ s 
ability to implement effective monitoring and reporting systems.  
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to NDIP.  Ev aluate the adequacy
of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’ s NDIP activities and the risks
they present.  Assess whether the  controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank
from money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. If applic able, review contractual arrangements with financial service providers .
Determine the BSA/AML compliance responsibility of each party .  Determine whether
these arrangements provide for adequate BSA/AML oversight.
3.Determine from a review of MIS reports (e.g., exception reports, funds transfer reports,
and activity monitoring reports) and internal risk rating factors, whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors NDIP, particularly those that pose a higher  risk for
money laundering.
4.Determine how the bank includes NDIP sales activities in its bank -wide or, if applicable,
firm-wide BSA/AML aggregation systems.
5.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring NDIP and for reporting suspicious
activities is adequate give n the bank’s size, complexity, location, and types of customer
relationships.
6. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance.
Transaction Testing  
If the bank or its majority-owned subsidiary is responsible for the sale or direct monitoring of NDIP, then examiners should perform the following transaction testing 
procedures on customer accounts established by the bank: 
7. On the basis of the bank’ s risk assessment of its NDIP activities,  as well as prior
examination and audit reports, select a sample of higher- risk NDIP .  From the sample
selected, perform the following examination procedures:
•Review appropriate documentation, including CIP, to ensure that adequate due
diligence has been performed and appropriate records are maintained.
•Review account statements and, as necessary, specific transaction details for:
− Expected transactions with actual activity.
− Holdings in excess of the customer’s net worth.

Insurance — Overview 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  258 2/27/2015.V2  Insurance — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
the sale of covered insurance products, and management’ s ability to implement effective 
monitoring and reporting systems.  
Banks engage in insurance sales to increase their profitability, mainly through expanding and diversifying fee -based income.  Insurance products are typically sold to bank customers 
through networking arrangements with an affiliate, an operating subsidiary, or other third -
party insurance providers.  Banks are also interested in providing cross-selling opportunities for customers by expanding the insurance products they offer.  Typically, banks take a role as 
a third -party a gent selling covered insurance products.  The types of insurance products sold 
may include life, health, property and casualty, and fixed or variable annuities. 
AML Compliance Programs and Suspicious Activity Reporting 
Requirements for Insurance Companies  
FinCEN regulations impose AML compliance program requirements and SAR obligations on 
insurance companies similar to those that apply to banks.236 The insurance regulations apply 
only to insurance companies; there are no independent obligations for brokers an d agents.  
However, the insurance company is responsible for the conduct and effectiveness of its AML 
compliance program, which includes agent and broker activities.  The insurance regulations 
only apply to a limited range of products that may pose a higher risk of abuse by money launderers and terrorist financiers .  A covered product, for the purposes of an AML 
compliance program, includes: 
•A permanent life insurance policy, other than a group life insurance policy.
•Any annuity contract, other than a group annuity contract.
•Any other insurance product with features of cash value or investment.
When an insurance agent or broker already is required to establish a BSA/ AML compliance 
program under a separate requirement under BSA regulations (e.g., bank or securities broker 
requirements), the insurance company generally may rely on that compliance program to 
address issues at the time of sale of the covered product.
237 However, the bank may need to 
establish specific policies, pr ocedures, and processes for its insurance sales in order to submit 
information to the insurance company for the insurance company’ s AML compliance.  
Likewise, if a bank, as an agent of the insurance company, detects unusual or suspicious activity relating to insurance sales, it can file a joint SAR on the common activity with the 
insurance company.

Insurance — Overview 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  259 2/27/2015.V2  In April 2008, FinCEN published a strategic analytical report that provides information 
regarding certain money laundering trends, patterns, and typologies in connection with insurance products.  Refer to Insurance Industry Suspicious Activity Reporting: An 
Assessment of Suspicious Activity Report Filings  on the FinCEN Web site
.  
Risk Factors  
Insurance products can be used to facilitate money laundering .  For example, currency can be 
used to purchase one or more life insurance policies, which may subsequently be quickly 
canceled by a policyholder (also known as “ early surrender” ) for a penalty .  The insurance 
company refunds the money to the purchaser in the form of a check.  Insurance policies 
without cash value or investment features are lower risk, but can be used to launder money or 
finance terrorism through the submission by a policyholder of inflated or false claims to its  
insurance carrier, which if paid, would enable the insured to recover a part or all of the originally invested payments.  Other ways insurance products can be used to launder money 
include: 
•Borrowing against the cash surrender value of permanent life insurance policies.
•Selling units in investment-linked products (such as annuities).
•Using insurance proceeds from an early policy surrender to purchase other financial
assets.
•Buying policies that allow the transfer of beneficial interests without the kno wledge and
consent of the issuer (e.g., secondhand endowment and bearer insurance policies).
239
•P
urchasing insurance products through unusual methods such as currency or currency
equivalents.
•Buying products with insurance termination features without concern for the product’ s
investment performance.
Risk Mitigation  
To mitigate money laundering risks, the bank should adopt policies, procedures, and 
processes that include:  
•The identification of higher-risk accounts.
•Customer due diligence, including EDD for hi gher-risk accounts.
•Product design and use, types of services offered, and unique aspects or risks of target
markets.
•Employee compensation and bonus arrangements that are related to sales.

Insurance  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
the sale of covered insurance products, and management’ s ability to implement effective 
monitoring and reporting systems. 
1.Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to insurance sales .  Evaluate the
adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank ’s insurance sales
activities, its role in insurance sales, and the risks the insurance sales present .  Assess
whether the controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering
and terrorist financing.
2.Review the contracts and agreements for the bank ’s networking arrangements with
affiliates, operating subsidiaries, or other third -party insurance providers conducting sales
activities on bank premises on behalf of the bank.
3. Depending on the bank’s responsibilities as set forth in the contracts and agreements,
review MIS reports (e.g., large transaction reports, single premium payments, early
policy cancellation records, premium overpayments, and assignments of claims) andinternal risk rating factors .  Determine whether the bank effectively identifies and
monitors covered insurance product sales.
4. Depending on the bank’s responsibilities as set forth in the contracts and agreements,
determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring covered insurance products for
suspicious activities, and for reporting suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’ s
size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.

Concentration Accounts  — Overview 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  262 2/27/2015.V2  Concentration Accounts — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’ s systems to manage the risks associated with 
concentration accounts, and management’ s ability to implement effective monitoring and 
reporting systems.  
Concentration accounts are internal accounts established to facilitate the processing and 
settlement of mu ltiple or individual customer transactions within the bank, usually on the 
same day .  These accounts may also be known as special -use, omnibus, suspense, settlement, 
intraday, sweep, or collection accounts.  Concentration accounts are frequently used to facilitate transactions for private banking, trust and custody accounts, funds transfers, and 
international affiliates.  
Risk Factors  
Money laundering risk can arise in concentration accounts if the customer- identifying 
information, such as name, transaction amount, and account number, is separated from the financial transaction .  If separation occurs, the audit trail is lost, and accounts may be 
misused or administered improperly.  Banks that use concentration accounts should implement adequate policies, procedures, and processes covering the operation and record keeping for these accounts .  Policies should establish guidelines to identify, measure, 
monitor, and control the risks. 
Risk Mitigation  
Because of the risks involved, management should be familiar with the nature of their customers ’ business and with the transactions flowing through the bank’ s concentration 
accounts .  Additionally, the monitoring of concentration account transactions is necessary to 
identify and report unusual or suspicious transactions.  
Internal controls are necessary to ensure that processed transactions include the identifying customer information .  Retaining complete information is crucial for compliance with 
regulatory requirements as well as ensuring adequate transaction monitorin g.  Adequate 
internal controls may include: 
•Maintaining a comprehensive system that identifies, bank- wide, the general ledger
accounts used as concentration accounts, as well as the departments and individuals
authorized to use those accounts.
•Requiring dual signatures on general ledger tickets.
•Prohibiting direct customer access to concentration accounts.
•Capturing customer transactions in the customer’ s account statements.
•Prohibiting customer’s knowledge of concentration accounts or their ability to directemployees to conduct transactions through the accounts.
•Retaining appropriate transaction and customer identifying information.

sample selected, perform the following examination procedures:
•Obtain account activity reports for selected concentration accounts.
•Evaluate the activity and select a sample of transactions passing through differentconcentration accounts for further review.
•Focus on higher-risk activity (e.g., funds transfers or monetary instrumentspurchases) and transactions from higher -risk jurisdictions.
7. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated with
concentration accounts.

Lending Activities  — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  265 2/27/2015.V2  Lending Activities — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
lending activities, and management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, 
monitoring, and reporting systems.  
Lending activities include, but are not limited to, real estate ,240 trade finance,241 cash -secured, 
credit card, consumer, commercial, and agricultural.  Lending activities can include multiple 
parties (e.g., guarantors, signatories, principals, or loan participants).  
Risk Factors  
The involvement of multiple parties may increase the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing when the source and use of the funds are not transparent.  This lack of transparency can create opportunities in any of the three stages of money laundering or terrorist financing 
schemes .  These schemes could include the following: 
•To secure a loan, an individual purchases a certificate of deposit with illicit funds.
•Loans are made for an ambiguous or illegitimate purpose.
•Loans are made for, or are paid for, a third party.
•The bank or the customer attempts to sever the paper trail between the borrower and the
illicit funds.
•Loans are extended to persons located outside the United States, particularly to those in
higher-risk jurisdictions and geographic locations.  Loans may also involve collateral
located outside the United States.
Risk Mitigation  
All loans are considered to be accounts for purposes of the CIP regulations .  For loans that 
may pose a higher risk for money laundering and terrorist financing, including the loans 
listed above, the bank should complete due diligence on related account parties (i.e., guarantors, signatories, or principals).  Due diligenc e beyond what is required for a particular 
lending activity var ies according to the BSA/AML risks present, but could include 
performing reference checks, obtaining credit references, verifying the source of collateral, and obtaining tax or financial statements on the borrower and any or all of the various parties 
involved in the loan. 
The bank should have policies, procedures, and processes to monitor, identify, and report 
unusual and suspicious activities.  The sophistication of the systems used to monitor lending account activity should conform to the size and complexity of the bank’s lending business.  For example, the bank can review loan reports such as early payoffs, past dues, fraud, or 
cash-secured  loans . 
240 FinCEN has published strategic analytical reports  on trends and patterns relating to mortgage loan fraud as 
well as money laundering through commercial and residential real estate.

Lending Activities  — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  266 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Lending Activities 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
lending activities, and management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, 
monitoring, and reporting systems. 
1.Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to lending activities.  Evaluate the
adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’ s lending activities
and the risks they present.  Assess whether the  controls are adequate to reasonably  protect
the bank from money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors higher-risk loan accounts.
3.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring loan accounts for suspicious
activities and for reporting of suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’ s size,
complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
4. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “ Offic e of Fo reign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance .
Transaction Testing  
5. On the basis of the bank’ s  risk assessment of its lending activities, as well as prior
examination and audit reports, select a sample of higher-risk loan accounts.  From the
sample selected, perform the following examination procedures:
•Review account opening documentation, including CIP, to ensure that adequate due
diligence has been performed and that appropriate records are maintained.
•Review, as necessary, loan hi story.
•Compare expected transactions with actual activity.
•Determine whether actual activity is consistent with the nature of the customer ’s
business and the stated purpose of the loan.  Identify any unusual or suspicious
activity.
6. On the basis of exami nation procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated withlending relationships.

Trade Finance Activities  — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  267 2/27/2015.V2  Trade Finance Activities — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
trade finance activities, and management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, 
monitoring, and reporting systems.  
Trade finance typically involves short- term financing to facilitate the import and export of 
goods.  These operations can involve payment if documentary requirements are met (e.g., letter of credit), or may instead involve payment if the original obligor defaults on the commercial terms  of the transactions (e.g., guarantees or standby letters of credit) .  In both 
cases, a bank ’s involvement in trade finance minimizes payment risk to importers and 
exporters .  The nature of trade finance activities , however, requires the active involvement of 
multiple parties on both sides of the transaction.  In addition to the basic exporter or importer 
relationship at the center of any particular trade activity, relationships may exist between the 
exporter and its suppliers and between the importer and i ts customers.  
Both the exporter and importer may also have other banking relationships.  Furthermore, 
many other intermediary financial and nonfinancial institutions may provide conduits and services to expedite the underlying documents and payment flows a ssociated with trade 
transactions .  Banks can participate in trade financing by , among other things, providing pre-
export financing, helping in the collection process, confirming or issuing letters of credit, discounting drafts and acceptances, or offering fee-based services such as providing credit and country information on buyers.  Although most trade financing is short- term and self -
liquidating in nature, medium-term loans (one to five years) or long- term loans (more than 
five years) may be used to finance the import and export of capital goods such as machinery 
and equipment. 
In transactions that are covered by letters of credit, participants can take the following roles: 
•Applicant .  The buyer or party who requests the issuance of a letter of credit.
•Issuing Bank.  The bank that i ssues the letter of credit on behalf of the Applicant and
advises  it to the Beneficiary either directly or through an Advising Bank.  The Applicant
is the Issuing Bank’ s customer .
•Confirming Bank.  Typically in the home country of the Beneficiary, at the request of
the Issuing Bank, the bank that adds its commitment to honor draws made by the
Beneficiary, provided the terms and conditions of the letter of credit are met.
•Advising B ank.  The  bank that advises the credit at the request of  the Issuing Bank.  The
Issuing Bank sends the original credit to the Advising Bank for forwarding to the
Beneficiary .  The Advising Bank authenticates the credit and advises it to the
Beneficiary .  There may be more than one Advising Bank in a letter of credit transaction .
The Advising Bank may  also be a Confirming Bank.
•Beneficiary .  The seller or party to whom the letter of credit is addressed.
•Negotiation.  The purchase by the nominated bank of drafts (drawn on a bank other than
the nominated bank) or documents under a complying presentation, by advancing or
--- Page 273 ---
Trade Finance Activities  — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  268 2/27/2015.V2  agreeing to advance funds  to the beneficiary on or before the banking day on which 
reimbursement is due to the nominated bank. 
•Nominated Bank.  The bank with which the credit is available or any bank in the case of
a credit available with any bank.
•Accepting Bank .  The bank that accepts a draft, providing a draft is called for by the
credit.  Drafts are drawn on the Accepting Bank that dates and signs the instrument.
•Discounting Bank.  The bank that discounts a draft for the Beneficiary after it has been
accepted by an Accepting Bank .  The Discounting Bank is often the Accepting Bank.
•Reimbursing Bank.  The bank authorized by the Issuing Bank to reimburse the Paying
Bank submitting claims under the letter of credit.
•Paying Bank.  The bank that makes payment to the Beneficiary of the letter of credit .
As an example, in a letter of credit arrangement, a bank can serve as the Issuing Bank, allowing its customer (the buyer) to purchase goods locally or internationally, or the bank can act as an Advising Bank, enabling its customer (the exporter) to sell its  goods locally or 
internationally .  The relationship between any two banks may vary and could include any of 
the roles listed above. 
Risk Factors  
The internationa l trade system is subject to a wide range of risks and vulnerabilities that 
provide criminal organizations with the opportunity to launder the proceeds of crime and move funds to terrorist organizations with a relatively low risk of detection . The involvem ent 
of multiple parties on both sides of any international trade transaction can make the process 
of due diligence more difficult.  Also, because trade finance can be more document -based 
than other banking activities, it can be susceptible to documentary fraud, which can be linked to money laundering, terrorist financing, or the circumvention of OFAC sanctions or other 
restrictions (such as export prohibitions, licensing requirements, or controls). 
While banks should be alert to transactions involving higher-risk goods (e.g., trade in 
weapons or nuclear equipment), they need to be aware that goods may be over- or under-valued in an effort to evade anti-money laundering or customs regulations, or to move funds or value across national borders.  For example, an importer may pay a large sum of money 
from the proceeds of an illegal activity for goods that  are essentially worthless and are 
subsequently di scarded .  Alternatively, trade documents, such as invoices, may be 
fraudulently altered to hide the scheme.  Variations on this theme include inaccurate or double invoicing, partial shipment of goods (short shipping) , and the use of fictitious goods.  
Illegal proceeds transferred in such transactions thereby appear sanitized and enter the realm 
of legitimate commerce .  Moreover, many suspect trade finance transactions also involve 
collusion between buyers and sellers. 
The Applicant’s true identity or ownership may be disguised by the use of certain corporate 
forms , such as shell companies or offshore front companies.  The use of these types of 
entities  results in a lack of transparency, effectively hiding the identity of the purchasing 
party, and thus increasing the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing.

Trade Finance Activities  — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  269 2/27/2015.V2  Risk Mitigation  
Sound CDD procedures are needed to gain a thorough understanding of the customer’s 
underlying business and locations served.  The banks in the letter of credit process ne ed to 
undertake varying degrees of due diligence depending upon their role in the transaction.  For example, Issuing Banks should conduct sufficient due diligence on a prospective customer  
before establishing the letter of credit .  The due diligence should include gathering sufficient 
information on Applicants and Beneficiaries , including their identities, nature of business, 
and sources of funding.  This may require the use of background checks or investigations, particularly in higher- risk jurisdictions .  As such, banks should conduct a thorough review 
and reasonably know their customers prior to facilitating trade-related activity and should have a thorough understanding of trade finance documentation .  Refer to the core overview 
section , “Customer Due Di ligence ,” page 56, for additional guidance. 
Likewise, guidance provided by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) has helped set important industry standards and is a resource for banks that provide trade finance services.
242 The Wolfsberg Group also has published suggested industry 
standards and guidance for banks that provide trade finance services.243 
Banks taking other roles in the letter of credit process should complete due diligence that is commensurate with their roles in eac h transaction.  Banks need to be aware that because of 
the frequency of transactions in which multiple banks are involved, Issuing Banks may not 
always have correspondent relationships with the Advising or Confirming Bank. 
To the extent feasible, b anks should review documentation, not only for compliance with the 
terms of the letter of credit, but also for anomalies or red flags that could indicate unusual or 
suspicious activity.  Reliable documentation is critical in identifying potentially suspicious 
activity.  When analyzing trade transactions  for unusual or suspicious activity, banks should 
consider obtaining copies of official  U.S. or foreign government import and export forms  to 
assess the reliability of documentation provided.
244 These anomalies could appear in shipping 
documentation, obvious under- or over-invoicing, government licenses (when required), or discrepancies in the description of goods on various documents.  Identification of these elements may not, in itself, require the filing of a SAR , but may suggest the need for further 
research and verification .  In circumstances where a SAR is warranted, the bank is not 
expected to stop trade or discontinue processing the transaction.  However, stopping the trade 
may be required to avoid a potential violation of an OFAC sanction. 
Trade finance transactions frequently use Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial 
Telecommunication (SWIFT) messages .  U.S. banks must comply with OFAC regulations, 
and when necessary, licensing in advance of funding.  Banks should monitor the names of the parties contained in these messages and compare the names against OFAC  lists.  Refer to 
242 Refer to the Financial Action Task Force’s report on Trade Based Money Laundering , June 23, 2006  and the 
Asia Pacific Group Typology Report on Trade Base Mone y Laundering , July 20, 2012.    
243 Refer to The Wolfsberg Trade Finance Principles , 2011 . 
244 For instance,  refer to  U.S. Customs a nd Border Protection Form 7501 (Entry Summary)   and U.S. 
Department of Commerce Form 7525 -V (Shipper’s Export Declaration) classify all U.S. imports and exports by 
10-digit harmonized codes.  
--- Page 275 ---
Trade Finance Activities  — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  270 2/27/2015.V2  overview section, “Office of Foreign Assets Control,” page  142, for guidance .  Banks with a 
high volume of SWIFT messages should determine whether their monitoring efforts are 
adequate to detect suspicious activity, particularly if the monitoring mechanism is not 
automated .  Refer to core overview section “Suspicious Activity Reporting, ” page  60, and 
expanded overview section, “Funds Transfers ,” pages 207, for additional guidance. 
Policies, procedures, and processes should also require a thorough review of all applicable trade documentation (e.g. , customs declarations, trade documents, invoices, etc.) to enable 
the bank to monitor and report unusual and suspicious activity, based on the role played by the bank in the letter of credit process.  The sophistication of the documentation review process and MIS  should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the bank’ s trade 
finance po rtfolio and its role in the letter of credit process .  In addition to OFAC filtering, the 
monitoring process should give greater scrutiny to: 
•Items shipped that are inconsistent with the nature of the customer’s business (e.g., a steel
company that starts dealing in paper products, or an information technology company
that starts dealing in bulk pharmaceuticals).
•Customers conducting business in higher- risk jurisdictions.
•Customers shipping items through higher- risk jurisdictions, including transit through
noncooperative countries.
•Customers involved in potentially higher- risk activities, including activities  that may be
subject to export/import restrictions  (e.g., equipment for military or police organizations
of foreign governments, weapons, ammunition, chemical mixtures, classified defense
articles, sensitive technical data, nuclear materials, precious gems , or certain natural
resources such as metals, ore, and crude oil ).
•Obvious over- or under-pricing of goods and services.
•Obvious misrepresentation of quantity or type of goods import ed or export ed.
•Transaction structures that appear unnecessarily complex and designed to obscure the
true nature of the transaction .
•Customer direct s payment of  proceeds to an unrelated third party.
•Shipment locations or description of goods not consistent with l etter of credit.
•Significantly amended letters of credit without reasonable justification  or changes to the
beneficiary or location of payment.  Any changes in the names of parties also should
prompt additional OFAC review.
On February 18, 2010,  FinCEN issued an advisory to inform and assist the financial industry in reporting instances of suspected trade-based money laundering (TBML)
245.  The advisory 
contains examples of “red flags” based on activity reported in SARs that FinCEN and law 
enforcement believe may indicate trade -based money laundering.  In order to assist law

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  271 2/27/2015.V2  enforcement in its effort to target TBML and black market peso exchange (BMPE) activities, 
FinCEN requested in the advisory that financial institutions check the appropriate box in Part 
II, Suspicious Activity Information section of the SAR and include the abbreviation TBML 
or BMPE in the narrative section of the SAR.  The advisory can be found on the FinCEN 
Web site .  
Unless customer behavior or transaction documentation appears unusual, the bank should not 
be expected to spend undue tim e or effort reviewing all information .  The examples above, 
particularly for an Issuing Bank, may be included as part of its routine CDD process.  Banks with robust CDD programs may find that less focus is needed on individual transactions as a 
result of t heir comprehensive knowledge of the customer’ s activities.

Trade Finance Activities  — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  272 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Trade Finance Activities  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
trade finance activities, and management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, 
monitoring, and reporting systems. 
1.Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to trade finance activities .
Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes governing trade  finance-
related activities and the risks they present.  Assess whether the controls are adequate to
reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.Evaluate the adequacy of the due diligence information the bank obtains for the
customer ’s files .  Determine whether the bank has processes in place for obtaining
information at account opening, in addition to ensuring current customer information is
maintained.
3.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors the trade finance portfolio for suspicious or unusual
activities, particularly those that pose a higher risk for money laundering.
4.Determine whether the bank ’s system for m onitoring trade finance activities for
suspicious activities, and for reporting of suspicious activities, is adequate, given thebank’s size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
5. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures , “Office of Fo reign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance .
Transaction Testing  
6. On the basis of the bank’ s  risk assessment of its trade finance portfolio, as well as prior
examination and audit reports, select a sample of trade finance accounts .  From the
sample selected, review customer due diligence documentation to determine whether the
information is commensurate with the customer’s risk .  Identify any unusual or
suspicious activities.
7. Verify whether the bank monitors the trade finance portfolio for potential OFAC
violations and unusual transactional patterns and conducts and records the results of anydue diligence.
8. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of pol icies, procedures, and processes associated with
trade finance activities.

Private Banking — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  273 2/27/2015.V2  Private Banking — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
private banking activities, and management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, 
monitoring, and reporting systems.  This section expands the core review of the statutory and regulatory requirements of private banking in order to provide a broade r assessment of the 
AML risks associated with this activity.  
Private banking activities are generally defined as providing personalized services to higher 
net worth customers (e.g., estate planning, financial advice, lending, investment management, bill pa ying, mail forwarding, and maintenance of a residence) .  Private banking 
has become an increasingly important business line for large and diverse banking 
organizations and a source of enhanced fee income. 
U.S. banks may manage private banking relationships for both domestic and international 
customers .  Typically, thresholds of private banking service are based on the amount of 
assets under management and on the need for specific products or services (e.g., real estate management, closely held company overs ight, money management).  The fees charged are 
ordinarily based on asset thresholds and the use of specific products and services. 
Private banking arrangements are typically structured to have a central point of contact (i.e., 
relationship manager) that ac ts as a liaison between the client and the bank and facilitates the 
client ’s use of the bank’ s financial services and products .  Appendix N (“ Private Banking — 
Common Structure”) provides an example of a typical private banking structure and 
illustrates th e relationship between the client and the relationship manager .  Typical products 
and services offered in a private banking relationship include: 
•Cash management (e.g., checking accounts, overdraft privileges, cash sweeps, and bill-
paying services).
•Funds transfer s.
•Asset management (e.g., trust, investment advisory, investment management, andcustodial and brokerage services).
246
•T
he facilitation of shell companies and offshore entities (e.g., Pr ivate Investment
Companies (PIC ), international business corporations (IBC), and trusts).247
•L
ending services (e.g., mortgage loans, credit cards, personal loans, and letters of credit).
•Financial planning services including tax and estate planning.
•Custody services.
•Other services as requested (e.g., mail services).
246 For additional guidance, refer to the expanded overview and examination procedures, “Trust and Asset 
Management Services,” page 280 and 284, respectively.  
247 For additional guidance, refer to the expanded overview and examination procedures, “Business Enti ties 
(Domestic and Foreign),” pages 314 and 320 , respectively. 
--- Page 279 ---
Private Banking — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  274 2/27/2015.V2  Privacy and confidentiality are important elements of private banking relationships.  
Although customers may choose private banking services simply to manage their assets, they 
may also seek a confidential, safe, and legal haven for their capital .  When acting as a 
fiduciary, banks have statutory, contractual, and ethical obligations to uphold. 
Risk Factors  
Private banking services can be vulnerable to money laundering schemes, and past money laundering prosecutions have demonstrated that vulnerability.  The 1999 Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations’ Report  “Private Banking and Money Laundering: A Case 
Study of Opportunities and Vulnerabilities”
248 outlined, in part, the following vulnerabilities 
to money laundering: 
•Private bankers as client advocates.
•Powe rful clients including politically exposed persons (PEPs) , industrialists, and
entertainers.
•Culture of confidentiality and the use of secrecy jurisdictions or shell companies.249
•P
rivate banking culture of lax internal controls.
•Competitive nature of the business.
•Significant profit potential for the bank.
Risk Mitigation  
Effective policies, procedures, and processes can help protect banks from becoming conduits 
for or victims of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes that are perpetrated through private banking relationships.  Additional information relating to risk 
assessments and due diligence is contained in the core overview section , “Private Banking 
Due Diligence Program (Non -U.S. Persons),” page 125.  Ultimately, illicit activities through 
the private banking unit could result in significant financial costs and reputational risk to the bank.  Financial impacts could include regulatory sanctions and fines, litigation expenses, the loss of business, reduced liquidity, asset seizures and freezes, loan losses, and remediation 
expenses.  
Customer Risk Assessment 
Banks should assess the risks its private banking activities pose on the basis of the scope of 
operations and the complexity of the bank’ s customer relationships .  Manage ment should 
establish a risk profile for each customer to be used in prioritizing oversight resources and for ongoing monitoring of relationship activities .  The following factors should be considered 
when identifying risk characteristics of private bankin g customers:  
248 Refer to U.S. Senate, Committee on Governmental Affairs, Private Banking and Money Laundering: A Case 
Study of Opportunities and Vulnerabilities  
(frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgibin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_senate_hearings&docid=f:61699.pdf ).

Private Banking — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  275 2/27/2015.V2  •Nature of the customer’s wealth  and the customer’ s business.  The source of the
customer ’s wealth, the nature of the customer’s business, and the extent to which the
customer ’s business history presents an increased risk for money laundering a nd terrorist
financing .  This factor should be considered for private banking accounts opened for
PEPs.250
•Pur
pose and anticipated activity.  The size, purpose, types of accounts, products, and
services involved in the relationship, and the anticipated activity of the account.
•Relationship .  The nature and duration of the bank’s relationship (including relationships
with affiliates) with the private banking customer.
•Customer ’s corporate structure.  Type of corporate structure (e.g., IBCs, shell
companies (domestic or foreign), or PICs).
•Geographic l ocation and jurisdiction.  The geographic location of the private banking
customer ’s domicile and business (domestic or foreign).  The review should consider the
extent to which the relevant jurisdiction is internationally recognized as presenting a
greater risk for money laundering or, conversely, is considered to have robust AML
standards.
•Public information .  Information known or reasonably available to the bank about the
private banking customer.  The scope and depth of this review should depend on thenature of this relationship and the risks involved.
Customer Due Diligence  
CDD is essential when establishing any customer relationship and it is critical for private 
banking clients.251 Banks should take reasonable steps to establish the identity of their private 
banking clients and, as appropriate, the beneficial owners of accounts.252  Adequate due 
diligence should vary based on the risk factors identified previously.  Policies, procedures, and processes  should define acceptable CDD for different types of products (e.g., PICs), 
services, and accountholders.  As due diligence is an ongoing process, a bank should take measures to ensure account profiles are current and monitoring should be risk- based .  Bank s 
should consider whether risk profiles should be adjusted or suspicious activity reported when 
the activity is inconsistent with the profile.  
For purposes of the CIP, the bank is not required to search the private banking account to 
verify the identities of beneficiaries, but instead is only required to verify the identity of the 
250 Refer to the core overview section, “Private Banking Due Diligence Program (Non -U.S. Persons),” page 
125, and to the expanded overview section, “Politically Exposed Persons,” page 290, for additional guidance.  
251 Due diligence policies, procedures, and processes are required for private banking accounts for non -U.S. 
persons by section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act.  Refer to the core overview section, “Private Banking Due 
Diligence Program (Non -U.S. Persons),” page 125, for additional guidance.  
252 Guidance on Obtaining and Retaining Beneficial Ownership Information , was issued by FinCEN, Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, and Securities and Exchange Commission, in consultation with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in May 2010.   
The guidance cons olidates existing regulatory expectations for obtaining beneficial ownership information for 
certain accounts and customer relationships.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  276 2/27/2015.V2  named accountholder.  However, the CIP rule also provides that, based on the bank’s risk 
assessment of a new account opened by a customer that is not an individual (e.g., private banking accounts opened for a PIC), the bank may need “to obtain information about” individuals with authority or control over such an account, including signatories, in order to verify the customer’s identity
253 and to determine whether the account is maintained for non-
U.S. persons.254 
Before opening accounts, banks should collect the following information from the private 
banking clients:  
•Purpose of the account.
•Type of products and services to be used.
•Anticipated account activity.
•Description and history o f the source of the client ’s wealth.
•Client’ s estimated net worth, including financial statements.
•Current source of funds for the account.
•References or other information to confirm the reputation of the client.
Bearer Shares  
Some shell companies issue bearer shares (i.e., ownership is vested via bearer shares, which 
allows ownership of the corporation to be conveyed by simply transferring physical possession of the shares) .  Risk mitigation of shell companies that issue bearer  shares may 
include maintaining control of the bearer shares, entrusting the shares with a reliable independent third party, or requiring periodic certification of ownership.  Banks should assess the risks these relationships pose and determine the appropr iate controls .  For 
example, in most cases banks should choose to maintain (or have an independent third party  
maintain ) bearer shares for customers .  In rare cases involving lower -risk, well-known, long-
time customers, banks may find that periodically re- certifying beneficial ownership is 
effective.  A strong CDD program is a n effective  underlying control through which banks 
can determine the nature, purpose, and expected use of shell companies and apply 
appropriate monitoring and documentation standards. 
Convertible Shares  
Certain jurisdictions also allow for registered shares to be converted to bearer shares.  These types of entities also carry the same type of risk as bearer shares, primarily centered on the lack of transparency regarding the potential transfer of ownership or control of those shares.  Risk mitigation for relationships belonging to corporate entities with a convertibility option is essentially the same as traditional bearer shares.  Financial institutions should assess the risk posed by these relationships and implement appropriate and ongoing beneficial ownership

form without prior notification from the customer or require control of the shares by a 
reliable independent third party.  
Board of Directors and Senior Management Oversight  
The board of directors’ and senior management’s active oversight of private banking 
activities and the creation of an appropriate corporate oversight culture are crucial elements of a sound risk management and control environment.  The purpose and objectives of the organization’s private banking activities should be clearly identified and communicated by the board and senior management.  Well -developed goals and objectives should describe the 
target client base in terms of minimum net worth, investable assets, and types of products and services sought .  Goals and objectives should also specifically describe the types of clients 
the bank does and does  not accept and sh ould establish appropriate levels of authorization for 
new-client acceptance.  Board and senior management should also be actively involved in 
establishing control and risk management goals for private banking activities, including effective audit and compliance reviews .  Each bank should ensure that its policies, 
procedures, and processes for conducting private banking activities are evaluated and updated regularly and ensure that roles, responsibilities, and accountability are clearly 
delineated.  
Employee  compensation plans are often based on the number of new accounts established or 
on an increase in managed assets.  Board and senior management should ensure that 
compensation plans do not create incentives for employees to ignore appropriate due diligence  and account opening procedures, or possible suspicious activity relating to the 
account .  Procedures that require various levels of approval for accepting new private 
banking accounts can minimize such opportunities. 
Given the sensitive nature of private banking and the potential liability associated with it, 
banks should thoroughly investigate the background of newly hired private banking relationship managers.  During the course of employment, any indications of inappropriate 
activities should be promptly investigated by the bank . 
Additionally, when private banking relationship managers change employers, their customers 
often move with them.  Banks bear the same potential liability for the existing customers of newly hired officers as they do for any new, private banking relationship.  Therefore, those 
accounts should be promptly reviewed using the bank’s procedures for establishing new 
account relationships. 
MIS and reports are also important in effectively supervising and managing private banking 
relationships and risks.  Board and senior management should review relationship manager 
compensation reports, budget or target comparison reports, and applicable risk management reports .  Private banker MIS reports should enable the relationship manager to view and 
manage the whole client and any related client relationships.

Private Banking — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  278 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Private Banking 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
private banking activities, and management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, 
monitoring, and reporting systems.  This section expands the core review of the statutory and regulatory requirements of private banking in order to provide a broader assessment of the 
AML risks associated with this activity.  
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to private banking activities.
Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’ s private
banking activities and the risks they represent.  Assess whether the  controls are adequate
to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.From  a review of MIS report s (e.g., customer aggregation, policy exception and missing
documentation, customer risk classification, unusual accounts activity, and client
concentrations) and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank effectivelyidentifies and monitors private banking relationships, particularly those that pose a higher
risk for money laundering.
3.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring private banking relationships for
suspicious activities, and for reporting of suspicious activities, is adequate given thebank’s size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
4. Review the private banking compensation program.  Determine whether it includes
qualitative measures that are provided to employees to comply with account opening andsuspicious activity monitoring and reporting requirements.
5. Review the monitoring program the bank uses to oversee the private banking relationship
manager ’s personal financial condition and to detect any inappropriate activities.
6. If appropriate, r efer to the core examination procedures, “ Office of Foreign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance .
Transaction Testing  
7. On the basis of the bank’ s  risk assessment of its private banking activities, as well as
prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of private banking accounts .  The
sample should include the following types of accounts:
•Politically exposed persons (PEP ).
•Private investment companies (PIC), international business corporations (IBC), and
shell companies.
•Offshore entities.
•Cash-intensive businesses.
•Import or export companies.

Trust and Asset Management Services  — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  280 2/27/2015.V2  Trust and Asset Management Services — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’ s policies, procedures, processes, and systems 
to manage the risks associated with trust and asset management255 services, and 
management’s ability to implement effective due diligence, monitoring, and reporting 
systems.  
Trust256 accounts are generally defined as a legal arrangement in which one party (the trustor 
or grantor) transfers ownership of assets to a person or bank (the trustee) to be held or used 
for the benefit of others.  These arrangements include the broad categories of  court-
supervised accounts (e.g., executorships and guardianships), personal trusts (e.g., living trusts, trusts established under a will, and charitable tru sts), and corporate trusts (e.g., bond 
trusteeships). 
Unlike trust arrangements, agency accounts are established by contract and governed by 
contract law .  Assets are held under the terms of the contract, and legal title or ownership 
does not transfer to the bank as agent.  Agency accounts include custody, escrow, investment management,
257 and safekeeping relationships.  Agency products and services may be 
offered in a traditional trust department or through other bank departments. 
Customer Identification Program  
CIP rules, which became effective October 1, 2003, apply to substantially all bank account s 
opened after that date.  The CIP rule defines an “account” to include cash management, 
safekeeping, custodian, and trust relationships.  The definition of account in the CIP rule does not include an account for the purpose of participating in an e mployee  benefit plan 
established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 19 74 (ERISA).
258  
In the case of employee benefit plan accounts that are subject to ERISA that are established as trusts, the bank’s customer is the employee benefit plan trust es tablished by the employer 
to hold the assets of the employee benefit plan.  Such plans often have individual participant or beneficiary accounts.  For purposes of the CIP rule, a participant in or beneficiary of such an account is  not be deemed to be the bank’s “customer,” as such a person has  not initiated 
the relationship with the bank.  The account is  not be considered opened by the employee 
even if a subaccount is maintained in the employee’s name, or the employee is able to contribute assets into the account, so long as the employee contribution is limited to rolling over assets from another plan, elective salary deferral contributions, purchasing securities or 
255 Asset management accounts can be trust or agency accounts and are managed by the bank.  
256 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency uses the broader term “fiduciary capacity” instead of “trust.” 
Fiduciary capacity includes a trustee, an executor, an administrator, a registrar of stocks and bonds, a transfer 
agent, a guardian, an assignee, a receiver, or a custodian under a uniform gifts to minors act; an investment 
adviser, if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice; and any capacity in which the bank possesses 
investment discretion on behalf of another (12 CFR 9.2(e) and 12 CFR 550.30).  
257 For purposes of national banks and savings associations, certain investment management activities, such  as 
providing investment advice for a fee, are “fiduciary” in nature.  
258 Refer to the Interagency Interpretive Guidance on Customer Identification Program Requirements under 
Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act , August 28, 2005.

Trust and Asset Management Services  — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  281 2/27/2015.V2  exercising options to purchase securities, or repaying a loan, in accordance with the terms of 
the plan.  For employee benefit plan accounts that are not subject to ERISA such as employee benefi t plan accounts established by government entities, the bank’s customer is 
the employer that contracts with the bank to establish the account.  By contrast, where an 
individual opens an individual retirement account in a bank, the individual who opens the account is the bank's "customer." 
F
or purposes of the CIP, the bank is not required to search the trust, escrow, or similar 
accounts to verify the identities of beneficiaries, but instead is only required to verify the identity of the named accountholder (the trust) .  In the case of a trust account, the customer is 
the trust whether or not the bank is the trustee for the trust.  However, the CIP rule also provides that, based on the bank’ s risk assessment of a new account opened by a customer 
that is not a n individual, the bank may need “to obtain information about” individuals with 
authority or control over such an account, including signatories, in order to verify the customer ’s identity.
259 For example, in certain circumstances involving revocable trusts, the 
bank may need to gather information about the settlor, grantor, trustee, or other persons with the authority to direct the trustee, and who thus have authority or control over the account, in 
order to establish the true identity of the customer. 
In the case of an escrow account, if a bank establishes an account in the name of a third 
party, such as a real estate agent, who is acting as escrow agent, then the bank ’s customer is 
the escrow agent .  If the bank is the escrow agent, then the person who establishes the 
account is the bank’ s customer .  For example, if the purchaser of real estate directly opens an 
escrow account and deposits funds to be paid to the seller upon satisfaction of specified 
conditions, the bank’ s customer is the purchaser.  Further,  if a company in formation 
establishes an escrow account for investors to deposit their subscriptions pending receipt of a required minimum amount, the bank’ s customer is the company in formation (or if not yet a 
legal entity, the person opening the account on its behalf).  However, the CIP rule also provides that, based on the bank’ s risk assessment of a new account opened by a customer 
that is not an individual, the bank may need “to obtain information about” individuals with authority or control over such an account, including signatories, in order to verify the 
customer ’s identity.
260 
Risk Factors  
Trust and asset management accounts, including agency relationships, present BSA/AML 
concerns similar to those of deposit taking, lending, and other traditional banking activities.  
Concerns are primarily due to the unique relationship structures involved when the bank 
handles trust and agency activities, such as: 
•Personal and court-supervised accounts.
•Trust accounts formed in the private banking department.
•Asset management and investment advisory accounts.
259 Refer to 31 CFR 1020.220(a)(2(ii)(C).  
260 Id.

Trust and Asset Management Services  — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  282 2/27/2015.V2  •Global and domestic custody accounts.
•Securities lending.
•Employee benefit and retirement accounts.
•Corporate trust accounts.
•Transfer agent accounts.
•Other relat ed business lines.
As in any account relationship, money laundering risk may arise from trust and asset 
management activities .  When misused, trust and asset management accounts can conceal the 
sources and uses of funds, as well as the identity of benefici al and legal owners .  Customers 
and account beneficiaries may try to remain anonymous in order to move illicit funds or avoid scrutiny.  For example, customers may seek a certain level of anonymity by creating 
private investment c ompanies (PIC ),
261 offshore trusts, or other investment entities that hide 
the true ownership or beneficial interest of the trust.  
Risk Mitigation  
Management should develop policies, procedures, and processes that enable the bank to identify unusual account relationships and circumstances, questionable assets and sources of assets, and other potential areas of risk (e.g., offshore accounts, PIC s, asset protection trusts 
(APT),
262 agency accounts, and unidentified beneficiaries).  While the majority of traditional 
trust and asset management accounts do not need EDD, management should be alert to those 
situations that need additional review or research. 
Customer Comparison Against Lists  
The bank must maintain required CIP information and complete the required one- time check 
of trust account names against section 314(a) search requests.  The bank should also be able to identify customers who may be politically exposed persons (PEP), doing business with or located in a jurisdiction designated as “primary money laundering concern” under section 
311 of the USA PATRIOT  Act, or match OFAC lists.
263 As a sound practice, the bank 
should also determine the identity of other parties that may have control over the account, such as grantors or co -trustees .  Refer to the core overview section , “Information  Sharing,” 
261 For additional guidance on PICs , refer to the expanded overview section, “Business Entities (Domestic and 
Foreign),” page  314. 
262 APTs are a special form of irrevocable trust, usually created (settled) offshore for the principal purposes of 
preserving and protecting part of one’s wealth against creditors.  Title to the asset is transferred to a person 
named as the trustee.  APTs are generally tax neutral with the ultimate function of providing for the 
beneficiaries.  
263 Management and examiners should be aware that OFAC list -matching is not a BSA requirement.  However, 
because trust systems are typically separate and distinct from bank  systems, verification of these checks on the 
bank system is not sufficient to ensure that these checks are also completed in the trust and asset management department.  Moreover, OFAC’s position is that an account beneficiary has a future or contingent in terest in 
funds in an account and, consistent with a bank’s risk profile, beneficiaries should be screened to assure OFAC 
compliance.  Refer to the core overview section, “Office of Foreign Assets Control,” page 142, for additional 
guidance.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  283 2/27/2015.V2  page 92, and expanded overview section, “Politically Exposed Persons,” page 290, for 
additional guidance.  
Circumstances Warranting Enhanced Due Diligence  
Management should assess account risk on the basis of a variety of factors, which may inclu de: 
•Type of trust or agency account and its size.
•Types and frequency of transactions.
•Country of residence of the principals or beneficiaries, or the country where established,
or source of funds.
•Accounts and transactions that are not usual and customary for the customer or for thebank.
•Stringent documentation, verification, and transaction monitoring procedures should be
established for accounts that management considers as higher risk .  Typically, employee
benefit accounts and court- supervised accounts  are among the lowest BSA/AML risks.
The following are examples of situations in which EDD may be appropriate: 
•Bank is entering into a relationship with a new customer.
•Account principals or beneficiaries reside in a foreign jurisdiction, or the trust or i ts
funding mechanisms are established offshore.
•Assets or transactions are atypical for the type and character of the customer.
•Account type, size, assets, or transactions are atypical for the bank.
•International funds transfers are conducted, particularly through offshore funding
sources.
•Accounts are funded with easily transportable assets such as gemstones, precious metals,coins, artwork, rare stamps, or negotiable instruments.
•Accounts or relationships are maintained in which the identities of the principals, orbeneficiaries, or sources of funds are unknown or cannot easily be determined.
•Accounts benefit charit able organizations or other nongovernmental organizations (NGO )
that may be used as a conduit for illegal activities.

amounts.
•Account assets that include PICs.
•PEPs are parties to any accounts or transactions.

Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s policies, procedures, processes, and systems 
to manage the risks associated with trust and asset management265 services, and 
management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, monitoring, and reporting 
systems.  
If this is a standalone trust examination, refer to the core examination procedures, “Scoping 
and Planning,” page  15, for comprehensive guidance on the BSA/AML examination scope.  
In such instances, the trust examination may need  to cover additional areas, including 
training, the BSA compliance officer, independent review, and follow- up items.  
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to trust and asset management
services .  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, p rocedures, and processes given the
bank’s trust and asset management activities and the risks they present.  Assess whetherthe controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank from money laundering and
terrorist financing.
2.Review the bank ’s procedures for gathering additional identification information, when
necessary, about the settlor, grantor, trustee, or other persons with authority to direct a
trustee, and who thus have authority or control over the account, in order to establish a
true identit y of the customer.
3.From a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors trust and asset management relationships, particularly
those that pose a higher risk for money laundering.
4. Determine how the bank includes trust and asset management relationships in a bank-
wide or, if appropriate, firm -wide BSA/AML aggregation systems.
5.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring trust and asset management
relationships for suspicious activities, and for reporting of suspicious activities, isadequate given the bank ’s size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.

Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Individuals — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  286 2/27/2015.V2  EXPANDED EXAMINATION  OVERVIEW  AND 
PROCEDURES FOR PERSONS AND ENTITIES  
Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Individuals — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
transactions involving accounts held by nonresident aliens (NRA ) and foreign individuals, 
and management’s ability to implement effective due diligence, monitoring, and reporting 
systems.  
Foreign individuals maintaining relationships with U.S. banks can be divided into two 
categories: resident aliens and nonresident aliens .  For definitional purposes, an NRA is a 
non-U.S. citizen who: (i) is not a lawful permanent resident of the United States during the calendar year and who does not meet the substantial presence test,
266 or (ii) has  not been 
issued an alien registration receipt card, also known as a green card.  The IRS determines the 
tax liabilities of a foreign person and officially defines the person as a “resident ” or 
“nonresident.” 
Although NRAs are not permanent residents, they may have a legitimate need to establish an 
account relationship with a U.S. bank.  NRAs use bank products and services for asset 
preservation (e.g., mitigating losses due to exchange rates), business expansion, and investments .  The amount of NRA deposits in the U.S. banking system has been estimated to 
range from hundreds of billions of dollars to about $1 trillion.  Even at the low end of the range, the magnitude is substantial, both in terms of the U.S. banking system and the 
economy. 
Risk Factors  
Banks may find it more difficult to verify and authenticate an NRA accountholder’ s 
identification, source of funds, and source of wealth, which may result in BSA/AML risks.  
The NRA ’s home country may also heighten the account risk, depending on the secrecy law s 
of that country.  Because the NRA is expected to reside outside of the United States, funds transfers or the use of foreign automated teller machines (ATM) may be more frequent .  The 
BSA/AML risk may be further heightened if the NRA is a politically expo sed person (PEP).  
Refer to the expanded examination procedures, “Politically Exposed Persons,” page  294, for 
further information. 
266 A foreign national is a resident alien if the individual is physically present in the United States for at least 31 
days in the current calendar year and present 183 days or more based on counting: all days present during the 
current year, plus one -third of the days present in the preceding year, plus one -sixth of the days present in the 
second preceding year.  Certain days of presence are disregarded, such as (i) days spent in the United States for 
a medical condition that developed while the foreign national was present in the United States and unable to leave, (ii) days regular commuters spend traveling to or from Canada or Mexico, (iii) a day of less than 24 hours 
spent while in transit between two locations outside the United States., and (iv) days when the foreign national was an exempt individual.  The individual is considered a resident alien for federal income and employment tax 
purposes from the first day of physical presence in the United States in the year that the test is satisfied.  Refer 
to the IRS Web site
.  
--- Page 292 ---
Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Individuals — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  287 2/27/2015.V2  Risk Mitigation  
Banks should establish policies, procedures, and processes that provide for sound due 
diligence and verificat ion practices, adequate risk assessment of NRA accounts, and ongoing 
monitoring and reporting of unusual or suspicious activities.  The following factors are to be 
considered when determining the risk level of an NRA account: 
•Accountholder’s home country.
•Types of products and services used.
•Forms of identification.
•Source of wealth and funds.
•Unusual account activity.
NRA customers may request W -8 status for U.S. tax withholding.  In such cases, the NRA 
customer completes a W -8 form, which attests to the customer ’s foreign and U.S. tax- exempt 
status .  While it is an IRS form, a W -8 is not sent to the IRS, but is maintained on file at the 
bank to support the lack of any tax withholding from earnings.267 
The bank’s CIP should detail the identification requirements for opening an account for a 
non-U.S. person, including an NRA .  The program should include the use of documentary 
and nondocumentary methods to verify a customer.  In addition, banks must maintain  due 
diligence  procedures for private banking accounts for non-U.S. persons, including those held 
for PEPs or senior foreign political figures.  Refer to the core overview and examination 
procedures , “Private Banking Due Diligence Program (Non -U.S. Persons),” page s 125 and 
130, respectively, and the expanded overview and examination procedures, “Politically 
Exposed Persons,” pages 290 and 294, respectively .

Politically Exposed Persons — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  290 2/27/2015.V2  Politically Exposed Persons — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
senior foreign political figures, often referred to as “politically exposed persons” (PEP), and management’s ability to implement effective risk -based due diligence, monitoring, and 
reporting systems.  If the relationship is a private banking account 
268 refer to core overview  
section , “Private Banking Due Diligence Program (Non-U.S. Persons),” page  125, for 
guidance.  
Banks should take all reasonable steps to ensure that they do not knowingly or unwittingly assist in hiding or moving the proceeds of corruption by senior foreign political figures, their families,  and their associates .  Because the risks presented by PEPs vary  by customer, 
product/service, country, and industry , identifying, monitoring, and designing controls for 
these accounts and transactions should be risk- based.  
The term “politically exposed person” generally includes a current or former senior foreign political figure, their immediate family, and their close associates .  Interag ency guidance 
issued in January 2001 offers banks resources that can help them to determine whether an 
individual is a PEP.
269 More specifically:  
•A “senior foreign political figure” is a senior official in the executive, legislative,
administrative, militar y or judicial branches of a foreign government (whether elected or
not), a senior official of a major foreign political party, or a senior executive of a foreign
government-owned corporation.270 In addition, a senior foreign political figure includes
any cor poration, business, or other entity that has been formed by, or for the benefit of, a
senior foreign political figure.
•The “immediate family” of a senior foreign political figure typically includes the figure’sparents, siblings, spouse, children, and in-l aws.
•A “close associate” of a senior foreign political figure is a person who is widely andpublicly known to maintain an unusually close relationship with the senior foreignpolitical figure, and includes a person who is in a position to conduct substanti al domestic
and international financial transactions on behalf of the senior foreign political figure.
268 For purposes of 31 CFR 1010.620, a “private banking account” is an account (or any combination of 
accounts) maintained at a bank that satisfies all three of the following criteria:  
•Requires a minimum aggregate deposit of funds or other assets of not less than $1 million ;
•Is established on behalf of or for the benefit of one or more non -U.S. persons who are direct or beneficial
owners of the account; and
•Is assigned to, or is administered by, in whole or in part, an officer, employee, or agent of a bank acting
as a liaison between the covered financial institution and the direct or beneficial owner of the account.
269 Guidance on Enhanced Scrutiny for Transactions that may Involve the Proceeds of Foreign Official 
Corruption issued by the U.S. Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, and the U.S. 
Department of State, January 2001.  
270 It is important to note that while government -owned corpor ations may present risks of their own, the 
government -owned corporations themselves are not within the definition of a “senior foreign political figure.”  
--- Page 296 ---
Politically Exposed Persons — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  291 2/27/2015.V2  The definition of senior official or executive must remain sufficiently flexible to capture the 
range of individuals who, by virtue of their office or position, potentially pose a risk that their funds may be the proceeds of foreign corruption.
271 Titles alone may not provide sufficient 
information to determine if an individual is a PEP , because governments are organized 
differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction .  In those cases when a bank files a SAR 
concerning a transaction that may involve the proceeds of foreign corruption, FinCEN has instructed banks to include the term “foreign corruption” in the narrative portion of the SAR.
272 Banks should establish risk-based controls and procedures that include reasonable 
steps to ascertain the status of an individual as a PEP and to conduct risk- based scrutiny of 
accounts held by these individuals.  Risk var ies depending on other factors, such as products 
and services used  and size or complexity of the account relationship.  Banks also should 
consider various factors when determining if an individual is a PEP including: 
•Official responsibilities of th e individual’s office.
•Nature of the title (e.g., honorary or salaried).
•Level and nature of authority  or influence over government activities or other officials.
•Access to significant government assets or funds.
In determining the acceptability of higher-risk accounts, a bank should be able to obtain 
sufficient information to determine whether an individual is or is not a PEP .  For example, 
when conducting due diligence on a higher -risk account, it would be usual for a bank to 
review a customer’s income so urces, financial information, and professional background.  
These factors would likely require some review of past and present employment as well as 
general references that may identify a customer ’s status as a PEP .  Moreover, a bank should 
always keep in mind that identification of a customer’s status  as a PEP should not 
automatically result in a higher- risk determination; it is only one factor the bank should 
consider in assessing the risk of a relationship. 
Ascertaining whether a customer  has a close association with a senior foreign political figure 
can be difficult , although focusing on those relationships that are  “widely and publicly 
known” provides a reasonable limitation on expectations to identify close associates as PEPs .  
However, banks that have actual knowledge of a close association should consider their 
customer a PEP, even if such association is not otherwise widely or publicly known.  Banks are expected to follow reasonable steps to ascertain the status of an individual, and the federal banking agencies and FinCEN recognize that these steps may not uncover all close 
associations.  
Risk Factors  
In high-profile cases over the past few years, PEPs have used banks as conduits for their illegal activities, including corruption, bribery, a nd money laundering.  However, not all 
PEPs present the same level of risk .  This risk var ies depending on numerous factors, 
271 71 Fed. Reg. 495–515. 
272 Refer to Guidance to Financial Institutions on Filing Suspicious Activity Reports regarding the Proceeds of 
Foreign Corruption , FIN-2008- G005, April 17, 2008.

Politically Exposed Persons — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  292 2/27/2015.V2  including the PEP’s geographi c location, industry, or sector,  position, and level or nature of 
influence or authority .  Risk may also vary depending on factors such as the purpose of the 
account, the actual or anticipated activity, products and services used, and size or complexity 
of the account relationship. 
As a result of these factors, some PEPs may be lower risk and some may be h igher risk for 
foreign corruption or money laundering.  Banks that conduct business with dishonest PEPs 
face substantial reputational  risk, additional regulatory scrutiny, and possible supervisory 
action .  Red flags regarding transactions that may be relat ed to the proceeds of foreign 
corruption are listed in the January 2001 i nteragency guidance.  Banks also should be alert to 
a PEP’s access to, and control or influence over, government or corporate accounts ; the level 
of involvement of intermediaries, vendors, shippers, and agents in the industry or sector in which the PEP operates; and the improper use of corporate vehicles and other legal entities to 
obscure ownership. 
Risk Mitigation  
Banks should exercise reasonable judgment in designing and implementing policies, 
procedures, and processes regarding PEPs.  Banks should obtain risk- based due diligence 
information on PEPs and establish policies, procedures, and processes that provide for appropriate scrutiny and monitoring.  Having appropriate risk -based account opening 
procedures for large- dollar or higher-risk products and services is  critical .  The opening of an 
account  is the prime opportunity for the bank to gather information for all customers, 
including PEPs.  Commensurate with the identified level o f risk, due diligence procedures 
should include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
•Identify the accountholder and beneficial owner, including the nominal and beneficial
owners of companies, trusts, partnerships, private investment companies, or other legal
entities that are accountholders .
•Seek information directly from the account holder and beneficial owner regardingpossible PEP status.
•Identify the accountholder’s and beneficial owner’s countr(ies)  of residence  and the level
of risk for corruption and money laundering associated with these jurisdictions.
•Obtain information regarding employment, including industry and sector and the level ofrisk for corruption associated with the industries and sectors.
•Check references, as appropriate, to determine whether the account holder and beneficial
owner is or has been a PEP.
•Identify the account holder’s and beneficial owner’s source of wealth  and funds.
•Obtain information on immediate family members or close associate s either having
transaction authority over the account or benefiting  from transactions conducted through
the account .
•Determine the purpose of the account and the expected volume and nature of accountactivity.
--- Page 298 ---
Politically Exposed Persons — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  293 2/27/2015.V2  •Make reasonable efforts to review public sour ces of information .  These sources vary
depending on each situation; however, banks should check the accountholder and any
beneficial owners of legal entities against reasonably accessible public sources of
information  (e.g., government databases, major ne ws publications, commercial databases
and other databases available on the Internet, as appropriate).
PEP accounts are not limited to large or internationally  focused banks.  A PEP can open an 
account at any bank, regardless of its size or location.  Banks should have risk -based 
procedures for identif ying PEP accounts and assess ing the degree of risks involved, which 
will vary .  Management should be involved in the decision to accept a PEP account.  If 
management determines after -the-fact that an account is  a PEP account, it should evaluate the 
risks and take appropriate steps.  The bank should exercise additional, reasonable due diligence with regard to such accounts.  For example, the bank may increase reference inquiries, obtain additional background information on the PEP from branches or correspondents operating in the client’s home country, and make reasonable efforts to consult publicly available information sources.  Ongoing risk -based monitoring of PEP accounts is 
critical to ensuring that the accounts are being used as anticipated .  Refer to core overview 
section, “Private Banking Due Diligence Progr am (Non -U.S. Persons),” page 125, for 
expectations regarding private banking relationships with PEPs.

1.R
eview the risk-based policies, procedures, and processes related to PEPs.  Evaluate the
adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’s PEP accounts andthe risks they present.  Assess whether the risk-based controls are adequate to reasonably
protect the bank from being used as a conduit for money laundering, corruption, and
terrorist financing.
2. Review the procedures for opening PEP accounts.  Identify management ’s role in the
approval and ongoing risk -based monitoring of PEP accounts.
3.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors PEP relationships, particularly those that pose a higher
risk for corruption, money laundering , and terrorist financing.
4.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring PEPs for suspicious activities, and
for reporting of suspicious activities, is adequate given the bank’s size, complexity,location, and types of customer relationships.
5. If appropria te, refer to core examination procedures , “Office of Fo reign Assets C ontrol,”
page 152, for guidance .
Transaction Testing  
6. On the basis of the bank’ s  risk assessment of its PEP relationships, as well as prior
examination and audit reports, select a sample of PEP accounts .  From the sample
selected, perform the following examination procedures:
•Determine compliance with regulatory requirements and with the bank ’s established
policies, procedures, and processes related to PEPs .
•Review transaction activity for accounts selected .  If necessary, request and review
specific transactions.
273 For purposes of 31 CFR 1010.620, a “private banking account” is an account (or any combination of 
accounts) maintained at a bank that satisfies all three of the following criteria:  
•Requires a minimum aggregate deposit of funds or other assets of not less than $1 million ;
•Is established on behalf of or for the benefit of one or more non -U.S. persons who are direct or beneficial
owners of the account;  and
•Is assigned to, or is administered by, in whole or in part, an officer, employee, or agent of a bank acting
as a liaison between the covered financial institution and the direct or beneficial owner of the account.

Embassy, Foreign Consulate, and Foreign Mission Accounts — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  296 2/27/2015.V2  Embassy , Foreign Consulate, and Foreign Mission Accounts — 
Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
transactions involving embassy, foreign consulate, and foreign mission accounts, and management’ s ability to implement effective due diligence, m onitoring, and reporting 
systems.  
Embassies contain the offices of the foreign ambassador, the diplomatic representative, and their staff .  The embassy, led by the ambassador, is a foreign government’ s official 
representation in the United States (or other country).  Foreign consulate offices act as 
branches of the embassy and perform various administrative and governmental functions (e.g., issuing visas and handling immigration matters) .  Foreign consulate offices are 
typically located in major metropolita n areas .  In addition, foreign ambassadors’ diplomatic 
representatives, their families, and their associates may be considered p olitically exposed 
persons (PEP ) in certain circumstances.
274  Embassies and foreign consulates in the United 
States require access to the banking system to meet many of their day -to-day financial 
responsibilities .  Such services can range from account relationships for operational expenses 
(e.g., payroll, rent, and utilities) to inter- and intragovernmental transactions (e.g., commercial and military purchases) .  In addition to official embassy accounts, some banks 
provide ancillary services or accounts to embassy staff, families, and current or prior foreign 
government officials.  Each of these relationships poses different levels of risk to the bank. 
Embassy accounts, including those accounts for a specific embassy office such as a cultural 
or education ministry, a defense attaché or ministry, or any other account, should have a specific operating purpose stating the official f unction of the foreign government office.  
Consistent with established practices for business relationships, these embassy accounts 
should have written authorization by the foreign government. 
In March 2011,the federal banking a gencies and FinCEN issued joint interagency guidance 
on providing account services to foreign embassies, consulates and missions (foreign 
missions).  This document supplements, but does not replace, guidance related to foreign 
governments and foreign political figures issued in June 2004.
275   
Risk Factors  
To provide embassy, foreign consulate, and foreign mission services, a U.S. bank may need to maintain a foreign correspondent relationship with the embassy’s, foreign consulate’s, or foreign mission’s bank.  Banks conducting business with foreign embassies , consulates , or 
missions  should assess and understand the potential risks of these accounts and should 
develop appropriate policies, procedures, and processes.  Embassy , foreign consulate , and 
foreign mission accounts may pose a higher risk in the following circumstances:

Figures (June 15, 2004); Updated Guidance on Accepting Accounts from  Foreign Embassies, Consulates and 
Missions (March 24, 2011) . 
--- Page 302 ---
Embassy, Foreign Consulate, and Foreign Mission Accounts — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  297 2/27/2015.V2  •Accounts are from countries that have been designated as higher risk.
•Substantial currency transactions take place in the accounts.
•Account activity is not consistent with the purpose of the account (e.g., pouch acti vity or
payable upon proper identification transactions) or account transactions are in unusual
amounts.
•Accounts directly fund personal expenses of foreign nationals, including but not limitedto expenses for college students.
•Official embassy business is  conducted through personal accounts.
Risk Mitigation  
Banks should obtain comprehensive due diligence information on embassy, foreign 
consulate, and foreign mission account relationships.  For private banking accounts for non-
U.S. persons specifically, banks must obtain due diligence information as required by 31 CFR 1010.620.
276  The bank ’s due diligence related to embassy , foreign consulate, and 
foreign mission account relationships should be commensurate with the risk levels presented.  In addition, banks are expected to establish policies, procedures, and processes that provide for greater scrutiny and monitoring of all embassy , foreign consulate, and foreign mission 
account relationships.  Management should fully understand the purpose of the account and the expected volume and nature of account activity.  Ongoing monitoring of these account 
relationships is critical to ensuring that the account relationships are being used as 
anticipated.  
Banks may also mitigate risk by entering into a written agreement that clearly defines the 
terms of use for the account(s) , setting forth available services, acceptable transactions and 
access limitations.  Written agreements to provide ancillary services or accounts to embassy, 
foreign consulate, and foreign mission personnel and their famil ies may also assist in 
mitigating the varying degrees of risk.  
Similarly, the bank could offer limited purpose accounts, such as those used to facilitate operational expense payments (e.g., payroll, rent and utilities, routine maintenance), which are generally considered lower ris k and allow the implementation of customary functions in 
the United States. The type and volume of transactions should be commensurate with the 
purpose of the limited access account. Account monitoring to ensure compliance with account limitations and the terms of any service agreements is essential to mitigate risks 
associated with these accounts.  
276 For additional guidance, refer to the core section overview,  “Private Banking Due Diligence Program (Non -
U.S. Persons),” page 125.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  298 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Embassy, Foreign Consulate , and Foreign Mission  Accounts  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
transactions involving embassy, foreign consulate and foreign mission accounts, and management’ s ability to imple ment effective due diligence, monitoring, and reporting 
systems.  
1.Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to embassy , foreign consulate , and
foreign mission accounts .  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and
processes given the bank ’s embassy , foreign consulate , and foreign mission accou nts and

Nonbank Financial Institutions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  299 2/27/2015.V2  Nonbank Financial Institutions — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
accounts of nonbank financial institutions (NBF I), and management’ s ability to implement 
effective monitoring and reporting systems. 
NBFIs are broadly defined as institutions other than banks that offer financial services .  The 
USA PATRIOT  Act has defined a variety of entities as financial institutions.277 Common 
examples of NBFIs include, but are not limited to : 
•Casinos and card clubs.
•Securities and commodities firms (e.g., brokers/dealers, investment advisers, mutual
funds, hedge funds, or commodity traders).
•Money services businesses (MSB).278
•I
nsurance companies.
•Loan or finance companies.279
•O
perators of credit card systems.
•Other financial institutions (e.g., dealers in precious metals, stones, or jewels;pawnbrokers).
Some NBFIs are curren tly required to develop an AML program, comply with the reporting 
and recordkeeping requirements of the BSA, and report suspicious activity, as are banks.
280  
NBFIs typically need access to banking services  in order to operate.  Although NBFIs 
maintain operating accounts at banks, the BSA does not require, and neither FinCEN nor the federal banking agencies expect, banks to serve as the de facto regulator of any NBFI 
industry or individual NBFI customer.  Furthermore, while banks are expected to manage 
risk associated with all accounts, including NBFI accounts, banks are not held responsible for 
their customers ’ compliance with the BSA and other applicable federal and state laws and 
regulations. 
277 Refer to Appendix D (“Statutory Definition of Financial Ins titution”) for guidance.  
278 MSBs include five distinct types of financial services providers and the U.S. Postal Service: (1) dealers in 
foreign exchange ; (2) check cashers; (3) issuers or sellers of traveler’s checks or money orders, ; (4)  providers 
or se llers of prepaid access; and (5) money transmitters.  FinCEN routinely publishes administrative letter 
rulings  that address inquiries regarding whether persons who engage in certain specific business activities are 
MSBs. 
279 77 Fed. Reg.  8148 (February 14, 2012)  defines non -bank residential mortgage lenders and originators as 
loan or finance companies for the purpose of requiring them to establish anti -money laundering programs and 
report suspicious activity.  FinCEN Guidance FIN -2012- R005, Compliance obligations of certain loan or 
finance company subsidiaries of Federally regulated banks and other financial institutions  (August 13, 2012), 
confirms that when a subsidiary loan or finance company is obligated to comply with the AML and SAR 
regulations that are applicable to its parent financial institution and is subject to examination by the parent financ ial institution’s Federal functional regulator, the loan or finance company is deemed to comply with 
FinCEN’s regulation.  
280 Refer to 31 CFR Chapter X for specific regulatory requirements. 
--- Page 305 ---
Nonbank Financial Institutions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  300 2/27/2015.V2  Risk Factors  
NBFI industries are ext remely diverse, ranging from large multi-national corporations to 
small, independent businesses that offer financial services only as an ancillary component to 
their primary business (e.g., grocery store that offers check cashing) .  The range of products 
and services offered, and the customer bases served by NBFIs, are equally diverse.  As a result of this diversity, some NBFIs may be lower risk and some may be higher risk for 
money laundering. 
Banks that maintain account relationships with NBFIs may be exp osed to a higher risk for 
potential money laundering activities because many NBFIs:  
•Lack ongoing customer relationships and require minimal or no identification from
customers.
•Maintain limited or inconsistent record  keeping on customers and transactions.
•Engage in frequent currency transactions.
•Are subject to varying levels of regulatory requirements and oversight.
•Can quickly change their product mix or location and quickly enter or exit an operation.
•Sometimes operate without proper registration or lice nsing.
Risk Mitigation  
Banks that maintain account relationships with NBFIs should develop policies, procedures, 
and processes to: 
•Identify NBFI relationships.
•Assess the potential risks posed by the NBFI relationships.
•Conduct adequate and ongoing due diligence on the NBFI relationships when necessary.
•Ensure NBFI relationships are appropriately considered within the bank’s suspicious
activity monitoring and reporting systems.
Risk Assessment Factors  
Banks should assess the risks posed by their NBFI customers and direct their resources most 
appropriately to those accounts that pose a more significant money laundering risk. 
The following factors may be used to help identify the relative risks within the NBFI 
portfolio.  Nevertheless, management should wei gh and evaluate each risk assessment factor 
to arrive at a risk determination for each customer and to prioritize oversight resources.  
Relevant risk factors include: 
•Types of products and services offered by the NBFI.
•Locations and markets served by the NBFI.
--- Page 306 ---
Nonbank Financial Institutions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  301 2/27/2015.V2  •Anticipated account activity.
•Purpose of the account.
A bank’s due diligence should be commensurate with the level of risk of the NBFI customer 
identified through its risk assessment.  If a bank’s risk assessment indicates potential for a 
heightened risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, the bank is  expected to conduct 
further due diligence in a manner commensurate with the heightened risk. 
Providing Banking Services to Money Services Businesses  
FinCEN and the federal banking agencies issued interpretive guidance on April 26, 2005, to clarify the BSA requirements and supervisory expectations as applied to accounts opened or maintained for MSBs.
281 With limited exceptions, many MSBs are subject to the full range of 
BSA regulatory requirements, including the anti-money laundering program rule, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting rules, and various other identification and recordkeeping rules.
282 Existing FinCEN regulations require certain MSB s to register with 
FinCEN.283 Finally, ma ny states have established supervisory requirements, often including 
the requirement that an MSB be licensed with the state (s) in which it is incorporated or does 
business. 
FinCEN defines MSBs as doing business in one or more of the following capacities: 
•Dealer in foreign exchange
•Check casher
•Issuer or seller of traveler’s checks or money orders
•Money transmitter
•Provider of prepaid access
281 Refer to Interagency Interpretive Guidance on Providing Banking Services to Money Services Businesses 
Operating in the United States , April 26, 2005.  
282 Refer to 31 CFR 1022.210 (requirement for MSBs  to establish and maintain an anti -money laundering 
program); 31 CFR 1022.310 (requirement for MSBs to file Currency Transaction R eports); 31 CFR 1022.320 
(requirement for MSBs to file Suspicious Activity R eports, other than for check cashing); 31 CFR 1010 .415 
(requirement for MSBs  that sell monetary instruments for currency  to verify the identity of the customer and 
create and maintain a record of each currency  purchase between $3,000 and $10,000, inclusive); 31 CFR 
1010.410(e) and (f) (rules applicable to certain transmittals of funds); and 1022.410 (additional recordkeeping 
requirement for dealers in foreign exchange including the requirement to create and maintain a record of each 
exchange of currency in excess of $1,000);1022.420 (additional recordkeepi ng requirements for providers or 
sellers of prepaid access) . 
283 Refer to 31 CFR 1022.380.  All MSBs must register with FinCEN (whether or not licensed as an MSB by 
any state) except: a business that is an MSB solely because it serves as an agent of another MSB; a business that 
is an MSB solely  as a seller of  prepaid access, ; the U.S. Postal Service; and agencies of the United States, of any state, or of any political subdivision of any state.  A business that acts as an agent for a principal or principals  engaged in MSB activities, and that does not on its own behalf  perform any other services of a nature 
or value that would cause it to qualify as an MSB, is not required to register with FinCEN.  FinCEN has issued 
guidance on MSB registration and de -regis tration.  Refer to 
Registration and De -Registration of Money 
Services Businesses , FIN -2006- G006, February 3, 2006.  
--- Page 307 ---
Nonbank Financial Institutions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  302 2/27/2015.V2  •Seller of prepaid access
•U.S. Postal Service
There is a threshold requirement for dealers in foreign exchange, check cashers and issuers or 
sellers of traveler’s checks or money orders.  A business that engages in such transactions is  
not be considered an MSB if it does not engage in such transactions in an amount greater than $1,000 for any person on any day in one or more transactions (31 CFR 1010.100(ff)).  An entity that engages in money transmission in any amount is considered an MSB.  
Thresholds for providers and sellers of prepaid access are discussed below. 
Prepaid Access  
FinCEN’s regulation for MSBs excluded certain prepaid access arrangements from the 
definition of prepaid programs.  Providers and sellers of prepaid access are not be considered 
MSBs  if they engage in prepaid arrangements excluded from the definition of a prepaid 
program under 31 CFR 1010.100(ff)(4)(iii).284  The exclusions include arrangements that : 
•Provide closed loop prepaid access to funds ( e.g., such as store gift cards) in amounts not
to exceed $2,000 maximum value per device on any day.
•Provide prepaid access solely to funds provided by a government agency.
•Provide prepaid access to fu nds for pre-tax flexible spending for health and dependent
care, or from Health Reimbursement Arrangements for health care expenses .
There are two types of prepaid access arrangements that have a qualified exclusion : 
•Open loop prepaid access that does not exceed $1,000 maximum value on any day.
•Prepaid access to employment benefits, incentives, wages or salaries (payroll) .
These arrangements are not prepaid programs subject to BSA regulatory requirements unless 
they can:   
•Be used internationally.
•Allow transfers of value from person to person within the arrangement, or
•Be reloaded from a non-depository source.
If any one of these features i s part of the arrangement, it is a covered prepaid program under 
31 CFR 1010.100.  
Administrators and Exchangers of Virtual Currency  
FinCEN’s regulations define currency as “the coin and paper money of the United States or 
of any other country that is desi gnated as legal tender; and that circulates; and is customarily

Nonbank Financial Institutions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  303 2/27/2015.V2  used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance.”  In contrast, 
“virtual” currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction .  Virtual currency must 
be converted into U.S. dollars through the services of an administrator or exchanger prior to 
deposit into the banking system.  An administrator or exchanger of virtual currency is an MSB under FinCEN’s regulations, specifically, a money transmitter, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person.
285  BSA requirements and supervisory 
expectations for providing banking services to administrator s or exchanger s of virtual 
currencies are the same as money transmitters .286  
Regulatory Expectations 
The following regulatory expectations apply to banks with MSB customers: 
•The BSA does not require, and neither FinCEN nor the federal banking agencies expect,
banks to ser ve as the de facto regulator of any type of NBFI industry or individual NBFI
customer, including MSBs.
•While banks are expected to manage risk associated with all accounts, including MSB
accounts, banks are not be held responsible for the MSB’ s BSA/ AML program.
•Not all MSBs pose the same level of risk, and not all MSBs require the same level of due
diligence .  Accordingly, if a bank’s assessment of the risks of a particular MSB
relationship indicates a lower  risk of money laundering or other illicit activity, a bank is
not routinely expected to perform further due diligence (such as reviewing informationabout an MSB’s BSA/ AML program) beyond the minimum due diligence expectations.
Unless indicated by the ri sk assessment of the MSB, banks are not expected to routinely
review an MSB ’s BSA/ AML program.
MSB Risk Assessment  
An effective risk assessment should be a composite of multiple factors, and depending upon the circumstances, certain factors may be given more weight than others.  The following 
factors may be used to help identify the level of risk presented by each MSB customer: 
•Purpose of the account.
•Anticipated account activity (type and volume).
•Types of products and services offered by the MSB.
•Locati ons and markets served by the MSB.
Bank management may tailor these factors based on their customer base or the geographic 
location s in which the bank operates.  Management should weigh and evaluate each risk 
assessment factor to arrive at a risk determination for each customer.  A bank’s due diligence

heightened risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, the bank is  expected to conduct 
further due diligence in a manner commensurate with the heightened risk. 
MSB Risk Mitigation 
A bank’s  policies, procedures , and processes should provide for sound due diligence and 
verification practices , adequate risk assessment of MSB accounts, and ongoing monitoring 
and reporting of unusual or suspicious activities.  A bank that establishes and maintains accounts for MSBs should apply appropriate, specific, risk- based , and where necessary, EDD 
policies , procedures, and controls. 
The factors below, while not all inclusive, may reduce or mitigate the risk in some MSB 
accounts:  
•MSB is registered with FinCEN and licensed with the appropriate state(s), if required.
•MSB confirms it is subject to examination f or AML compliance by the IRS or the
state(s), if applicable.
287
•M
SB affirms the existence of a written BSA/AML  program and provides the BSA
officer’s name and contact information.
•MSB has an established banking relationship and/or account activity consistent with
expectations.
•MSB is an established business with an operating history.
•MSB is a principal with one or a few agents, or is acting as an agent for one principal.
•MSB provides services only to local residents.
•Most of the MSB’s customers conduct routine transactions in low dollar amounts.
•The expected (lower -risk) transaction activity for the MSB’s business operations is
consistent with information obtained by bank at account opening.  Examples include the
following:
–Check cashing activity is limited to payroll or government checks (any dollar
amount).
–Check cashing service is not offered for third-party or out- of-state checks.
•Money- transmitting activities are limited to domestic entities ( e.g., domestic bill
payments) or limited to lower dollar amounts (domestic or international).
287 On December 9, 2008, FinCEN and the Internal Revenue Service released the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti -Money 
Laundering Examination Manual for Money Services Businesses (MSB Exam Manual ) which was developed in 
collaboration with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the Money Transmitter Regulators Association, 
and state agencies responsible for MSB regulation.  Refer to the MSB Exam Manual .

Nonbank Financial Institutions — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  305 2/27/2015.V2  MSB Due Diligence Expectations  
Registration with FinCEN, if required, and compliance with any state -based licensing 
requirements represent the most  basic of compliance obligations for MSBs .  As a result, it is 
reasonable and appropriate for a bank to require an MSB to provide evidence of compliance 
with such requirements, or to demonstrate that it is not subject to such requirements due to 
the nature of its financial services or status exclusively as an agent of another MSB (s). 
FinCEN issued a final rule clarifying  that certain foreign -located persons engaging in MSB 
activities within the United States fall within FinCEN’s definition of an MSB  and are 
required to register with FinCEN . 288 
Given the importance of licensing and registration requirements, a bank should file a SAR if 
it becomes aware that a customer is operating in violation of the registration or state licensing requirement .  There is no requirement in the BSA regulations for a bank to close an account 
that is the subject of a SAR .  The decision to maintain or close an account should be made by 
bank management under standards and guidelines approved by its board of directors. 
The ext ent to which the bank should perform further due diligence beyond the minimum due 
diligence obligations set forth below is dictated by the level of risk posed by the individual 
MSB customer .  Because not all MSBs present the same level of risk, not all MSB s require 
further due diligence.  For example, a local grocer that also cashes payroll checks for 
customers purchasing groceries may not present the same level of risk as a money transmitter 
specializing in cross -border funds transfers .  Therefore, the cus tomer due diligence 
requirements differ based on the risk posed by each MSB customer.  Based on existing BSA requirements applicable to banks, the minimum due diligence expectations associated with 
opening and maintaining accounts for any MSB
289 are: 
•Apply the bank’s CIP .290
•C
onfirm F inCEN registration, if required .  (Note: registration must be renewed every two
years .)
•Confirm compliance with state or local licensing requirements, if applicable.
•Confirm agent status, if applicable.
•Conduct a basic BSA/AML risk assessment to determine the level of risk associated with
the account and whether further due diligence is necessary.
If the bank determines that the MSB customer presents a higher level of money laundering or terrorist financing risk, EDD measures sh ould be conducted in addition to the minimum due 
diligence procedures.  Depending on the level of perceived risk, and the size and

following actions as part of an appropriate EDD  review:  
•Review the MSB’s BSA/ AML program.
•Review results of the MSB’s independent testing of its AML program.
•Review written procedures for the operation of the MSB.
•Conduct on- site visits.

Nonbank Financial Institutions — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  307 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Nonbank Financial Institutions  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
accounts of nonbank financial institutions (NBFI ), and management’ s ability to implement 
effective monitoring and reporting systems. 
1.Determine the extent of the bank ’s relationships with NBFIs and, for banks with
significant relationships with NBFIs, review the bank ’s risk assessment of this activity.
2. Review the policies, procedures, and process es related to NBFI accounts .  Evaluate the
adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’ s NBFI activities and
the risks they represent.  Assess whether the  controls are adequate to reasonably protect
the bank from money laundering and terrorist financing.
3. From review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors NBFI accounts.
4.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring NBFI accounts for suspicious
activities, and f or reporting of suspicious activities, is adequate given the nature of the
bank’ s customer relationships.
Money Services Businesses  
5. Consistent with the interagency guidance released on April 26, 2005, determine whether
t
he bank has policies, procedures, and processes in place for accounts opened or
maintained for money services businesses (MSB) to:
•Apply the bank’s CIP.291
•C
onfirm  FinCEN registration, if required .  (Note: registration must be renewed every
two years. )
•Confirm state licensing, if applicable.
•Confirm agent status, if applicable.
•Conduct a risk assessment to determine the level of risk associated with each account
and whether further due diligence is required.
6.Determine whether the bank ’s policies, procedures, and processes to assess risks posed
by MSB customers effectively identify higher-risk accounts and the amount of further
due diligence necessary.
291 Refer to 31 CFR 1020.100 (FinCEN); 12 CFR 21.21(Office of the Comptroller of the Currency); 12 CFR

Professional Service Providers — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  309 2/27/2015.V2  Professional Service Providers — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
professional service provider relationships, and management’ s ability to implement effective 
due diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems. 
A professional service provider acts as an intermediary between its client and the bank .  
Professional service providers include lawyers, accountants, investment brokers, and other 
third parties that act as financial liaisons for their clients .  These providers may conduct 
financial dealings for their clients .  For example, an attorney may perform services for a 
client, or arrange for services to be performed on the client ’s behalf, such as settlement of 
real estate transactions, asset transfers, management of client monies, investment services, 
and trust arrangements.  
A typical example is interest on lawyers ’ trust accounts (IOLTA).  These accounts contain 
funds for a lawyer’s various clients, and act as a standard bank account with one unique 
feature: The interest earned on the accou nt is ceded to the state bar association or another 
entity for public interest and pro bono purposes. 
Risk Factors  
In contrast to escrow accounts that are set up to serve individual clients, professional service provider accounts allow for ongoing business transactions with multiple clients .  Generally, a 
bank has no direct relationship with or knowledge of the beneficial owners of these accounts, 
who may be a constantly changing group of individuals and legal entities. 
As with any account that presents thi rd-party risk, the bank could be more vulnerable to 
potential money laundering abuse.  Some potential examples of abuse could include: 
•Laundering illicit currency.
•Structuring currency deposits and withdrawals.
•Opening any third-party account for the primary purpose of masking the underlying
client ’s identity.
As such, the bank should establish an effective due diligence program for the professional 
service provider as summarized below.  
Risk Mitigation  
When establishing and maintaining relationships with professional service providers, banks 
should adequately assess account risk and monitor the relationship for suspicious or unusual activity .  At account opening, the bank should have an understanding of the intended use of 
the account, including anticipated transaction volume, products and services used, and geographic locations involved in the relationship.  As indicated in the core overview section, “Currency Transaction Reporting Exemptions,” page 86, professional service providers 
cannot be exempted from currency transaction reporting requirements.

Professional Service Providers — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  310 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Professional Service Providers  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
professional service provider relationships, and management’ s ability to implement effective 
due diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems. 
1. Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to professional service provider
relationships.  Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the
bank’s relationships with professional service providers and the risks these relationships
represent .  Assess whether the  controls are adequate to reasonably protect the bank from
money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors professional service provider relationships.  MIS
reports should include information about an entire relationship .  For example, an interest
on lawyers’ trust account (IOLTA) may be in the name of the law firm instead of anindividual.  However, the bank’s relationship report should include the law firm’ s
account and the names and accounts of law yers asso ciated with the IOLTA.
3.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring professional service provider
relationship ’s suspicious activities, and for reporting of suspicious activities, is adequate
given the bank’s size, complexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
4. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “ Office of Fo reign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance .
Transaction Testing  
5. On the basis of the bank’ s  risk assessment of its relationships with professional ser vice
providers, as well as prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of higher- risk
relationships.  From the sample selected, perform the following examination procedures:
•Review account opening documentation and a sample of transaction activity.
•Determine whether actual account activity is consistent with anticipated (as
documented) account activity.  Look for trends in the nature, size, or scope of the
transactions, paying particular attention to currency transactions.
•Determine whether ongoing  monitoring is sufficient to identify potentially suspicious
activity.
6. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated withprofessio nal service provider relationships.

Nongovernmental Organizations and Charities — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  311 2/27/2015.V2  Nongovernmental Organizations and 
Charities — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’ s systems to manage the risks associated with 
accounts of nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and charities, and management’ s ability 
to implement effective due diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems. 
NGOs are private nonprofit organizations that pursue activities intended to serve the public 
good.  NGOs may provide basic social services, work to relieve suffering, promote the 
interests of the poor, bring citizen concerns to governments, encourage political participation, 
protect the environment, or undertake community development to serve the needs of citizens, organizations, or groups in one or more of the communities that the NGO operates.  An NGO 
can be any nonprofit organization that is independent from government. 
NGOs can range from large regional, national, or international charities to community -based 
self-help groups .  NGOs also include research institutes, churches, professional associations, 
and lobby groups.  NGOs typically depend, in whole or in part, on charitable donations and 
voluntary service for support. 
Risk Factors  
Because NGOs  can be used to obtain funds for charitable organizations, the flow of funds 
both into and out of the NGO can be complex, making them susceptible to abuse by money 
launderers and terrorists.  The U.S. Treasury issued guidelines to assist charities in adopt ing 
practices to reduce the risk of terrorist financing or abuse.292 
Risk Mitigation  
To assess the risk of NGO customers, a bank should conduct adequate due diligence on the organization.  In addition to required CIP information, due diligence for NGOs should focus 
on other aspects of the organization, such as the following: 
•Purpose and objectives of their stated activities .
•Geographic locations served (including headquarters and operational areas).
•Organizational structure.
•Donor and volunteer base.
•Funding and disbursement criteria (including basic beneficiary information).
•Recordkeeping requirements.
•Its affiliation with other NGOs, governments, or groups.
•Internal controls and audits.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  312 2/27/2015.V2  For accounts that bank management considers to be higher  risk, stringent documentation, 
verification, and transaction monitoring procedures should be established.  NGO accounts 
that are at higher risk for BSA/AML concerns include those operating or providing services internationally, conducting unusual or suspicious activities, or lacking proper documentation.  
EDD for these accounts should include: 
•Evaluating the principals.
•Obtaining and reviewing the financial statements and audits.
•Verifying the source and use of funds.
•Evaluating large contributors or grantors of t he NGO.
•Conducting reference checks.

Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  314 2/27/2015.V2  Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
transactions involving domestic and foreign business entities, and management’ s ability to 
implement effective due diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems. 
The term “business entities ” refers to limited liability companies, corporations, trusts, and 
other entities  that may be used for many purposes, such as tax and estate planning .  Business 
entities are relatively easy to establish .  Individuals, partnerships, and existing corporations 
establish business entities for legitimate reasons, but the entities may be abused for money 
laundering and terrorist financing. 
Domestic Business Entities 
All states have statutes governing the organization and operation of business entities, 
including limited liability companies, corporations, general partnerships, limited partnerships, and trusts.  Shell companies registered in the United States are a type of 
domestic
293 business entity that may pose heightened risks.294 Shell companies can be used 
for money laundering and other crimes because they are easy and inexpensive to form and operate.  In addition, ownership and transactional information can be concealed from regulatory agencies and law enforcement, in large part because most state laws require minimal disclosures of such information during the formation process.  According to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), law enforcement officials are 
concerned that criminals are increasingly using U.S. shell companies to conceal their identity 
and illicit activities.
295 
Shell companies can be publicly traded or privately held .  Although publicly traded shell 
companies can be used for illicit purposes, the vulnerability of the shell company is compounded when it is privately held and beneficial ownership can more easily be obscured or hidden.  Lack of transparency of beneficial ownership can be a desirable characteristic for 
some legitimate uses of shell companies, but it is also a serious vulnerability that can make some shell companies ideal vehicles for money laundering and other illicit financial activity .  
In some state jurisdictions, only minimal information is required to register articles of incorporation or to establish and maintain “good standing” for business entities — increasing 
the potential for their abuse by criminal and terrorist organizations.  
293 The term “domestic” refers to entities formed or organized in the United States.  These entities ma y have no 
other connection to the United States, and ownership and management of the entities may reside abroad.  
294 The term “shell company” generally refers to an entity without a physical presence in any country.  FinCEN 
has issued guidance alerting finan cial institutions to the potential risks associated with providing financial 
services to shell companies and reminding them of the importance of managing those risks.  Refer to Potential 
Money Laundering Risks Related to Shell Companies , FIN-2006- G013, November 2006. 
295 Refer to GAO ’s Company Formations — Minimal Ownership Information is Collected and Available , GAO -
06-376, April 2006.  For additional information, Refer to Failure to Identify Company Owners Impedes Law 
Enforcement , Senate Hearing 109 -845, held on November 14, 2006, and Tax Haven Abuses: The Enablers, The 
Tools & Secrecy, Senate Hearing  109-797, held on August 1, 2006, (particularly the Joint Report of the 
Majority and Minority Staffs of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations ).

Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  315 2/27/2015.V2  Foreign Business Entities 
Frequently used foreign entities include trusts, investment funds, and insurance companies.  
Two foreign entities that can pose particular money laundering risk are international business 
corporations (IBC) and Private Investment Companies (PIC) opened in offs hore financial 
centers (OFC ).  Many OFCs have limited organizational disclosure and recordkeeping 
requirements for establishing foreign business entities, creating an opportune environment 
for money laundering. 
International Business Corporations  
IBCs are entities formed outside of a person’ s country of residence that  can be used to 
maintain confidentially or hide assets .  IBC ownership can, based on jurisdiction, be 
conveyed through registered or bearer shares.  There are a variety of advantages to using an 
IBC that include, but are not limited to, the following: 
•Asset protection.
•Estate planning.
•Privacy and confidentiality.
•Reduction of tax liability.
Through an IBC, an individual is able to conduct the following: 
•Open and hold bank accounts.
•Hold and transfer funds.
•Engage in international business and other related transactions.
•Hold and manage offshore investments (e.g., stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and certificates
of deposit), many of which may not be available to “individuals” depending on their
location of residence.
•Hold corporate debit and credit cards, thereby allowing convenient access to funds.
Private Investment Companies  
PICs are separate legal entities .  They are essentially subsets of IBCs.  Determining whether 
a foreign corporation is a PIC is based on identifying the purpose and use of the legal vehicle.  
PICs are typically used to hold individual funds and investments, and ownership can be 
vested through bearer shares or registered shares .  Like other IBCs, PICs can offer 
confidentiality of ownership, hold assets centrally, and may provide intermediaries between 
private banking customers and the potential beneficiaries of the PICs.  Shares of a PIC may 
be held by a trust, which further obscures beneficial ownership of the underlying assets .  
IBCs, including PICs, are frequently incorporated in countries that impose low or no taxes on 
company assets and operations or are bank secrecy havens.  
--- Page 321 ---
Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  316 2/27/2015.V2  Nominee Incorporation Services  
Intermediaries, called nominee incorporation services (NIS), establish U.S. shell companies 
and bank accounts on behalf of foreign clients.  NIS may be located in the United States or offshore .  Corporate lawyers in the United States often use NIS to organize companies on 
behalf of their domestic and foreign clients because such services can efficiently organize legal entities in any state .  NIS must comply with applicable state and federal procedures as 
well as any specific bank requirements .  Those laws and procedures dict ate what information 
NIS must share about the owners of a legal entity .  Money launderers have also utilized NIS 
to hide their identities .  By hiring a firm to serve as an intermediary between themselves, the 
licensing jurisdiction, and the bank, a company’s beneficial owners may avoid disclosing their identities in state corporate filings and in corporate bank account opening 
documentation. 
An NIS has the capability to form business entities, open full-service bank accounts for those 
entities, and act as the registered agent to accept service of legal process on behalf of those 
entities in a jurisdiction in which the entities have no physical presence .  Furthermore, an 
NIS can perform these services without ever having to identify beneficial ownership on 
company formation, registration, or bank account documents. 
Several international NIS firms have formed partnerships or marketing alliances with U.S. 
banks to offer financial services such as Internet banking and funds transfer capabilities to shell companies and non-U.S. citizens.  U.S. banks participating in these marketing alliances by opening accounts through intermediaries without requiring the actual accountholder’s physical presence, accepting by mail copies of passport photos, utility bills, and other 
identifying information may be assuming increased levels of BSA/AML risk.
296 
Risk Factors  
Money laundering and terrorist financing risks arise because business entities can hide the 
true owner of assets or property derived from or associated with criminal a ctivity.297 The 
privacy and confidentiality surrounding some business entities may be exploited by 
criminals, money launderers, and terrorists.  Verifying the grantors and beneficial owner(s) of some business entities may be extremely difficult, as the characteristics of these entities 
shield the legal identity of the owner.  Few public records disclose true ownership.  Overall, the lack of ownership transparency; minimal or no recordkeeping requirements, financial disclosures, and supervision; and the r ange of permissible activities all increase money 
laundering risk. 
While business entities can be established in most international jurisdictions, many are 
incorporated in OFCs that provide ownership privacy and impose few or no tax obligations.  
To mainta in anonymity, many business entities are formed with nominee directors, 
officeholders, and shareholders.  In certain jurisdictions, business entities can also be

December 2005.  
297 For a general discussion of the risk factors associated with the misuse of business entities, refer to the 
Financial Action Task Force’s The Misuse of Corporate Vehicles, Including Trust and Company Service 
Providers , October 13, 2006.

Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  317 2/27/2015.V2  established using bearer shares; ownership records are not maintained, rather ownership is 
based on physical possession of the stock certificates.  Revocable trusts are another method 
used to insulate the grantor and beneficial owner and can be designed to own and manage the 
business entity, presenting significant barriers to law enforcement.  
While  the majority of U.S. -based shell companies serve legitimate purposes, some shell 
companies have been used as conduits for money laundering, to hide overseas transactions, 
or to layer domestic or foreign business entity structures.298 For example, regulators  have 
identified shell companies registered in the United States conducting suspicious transactions with foreign -based counterparties .  These transactions, primarily funds transfers circling in 
and out of the U.S. banking system, evidenced no apparent business purpose.  Domestic business entities with bank -like names, but without regulatory authority to conduct banking, 
should be particularly suspect.
299 
The following indicators of potentially suspicious activity may be commonly associated with  
shell company activity:  
•Insufficient or no information available to positively identify originators or beneficiaries
of funds transfers (using Internet, commercial database searches, or direct inquiries to a
respondent bank).
•Payments have no stated purpose, do not reference goods or services, or identify only acontract or invoice number.
•Goods or services, if identified, do not match profile of company provided by respondent
bank or character of the financial activity; a company references remarkably dissimilar
goods and services in related funds transfers; explanation given by foreign respondent
bank is inconsistent with observed funds transfer activity.
•Transacting businesses share the same address, provide only a registered agent ’s address,
or other address inconsistencies.
•Many or all of the funds transfers are sent in large, round dollar, hundred dollar, or
thousand dollar amounts.
•Unusually large number and variety of beneficiaries receiving funds transfers from onecompany.
•Frequent involvement of multiple jurisdictions or beneficiaries located in higher- risk
OFCs .
•A foreign correspondent bank exceeds the expected volume in its client profile for funds
transfers, or an individual company exhibits a high volume and pattern of funds transfers
that is inconsistent with its normal business activity .
298 Failure to Identify Company Owners Impedes Law Enforcement.  Refer to Senate Hearing 109 -845 held on 
November 14, 2006.  
299 The federal banking agencies notify banks and the public about entities engaged in unauthorized banking 
activities, both offshore and domestic.  These notifications can be found on the federal banking agencies’ Web 
sites.

Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  318 2/27/2015.V2  •Multiple high -value payments or transfers between shell companies with no apparent
legitimate business purpose.
•Purpose of the shell company is unknown or unclear.
Risk Mitigation  
Mana gement should develop policies, procedures, and processes that enable the bank to 
identify account relationships, in particular deposit accounts, with business entities, and 
monitor the risks associated with these accounts in all the bank’ s departments .  Business 
entity customers may open accounts within the private banking department, within the trust 
department, or at local branches .  Management should establish appropriate due diligence at 
account opening and during the life of the relationship to manage risk in these accounts.  The bank should gather sufficient information on the business entities and their beneficial owners to understand and assess the risks of the account relationship.  Important information for determining the valid use of these entities includes the type of business, the purpose of the 
account, the source of funds, and the source of wealth of the owner or  beneficial owner . 
The bank’s CIP should detail the identification requirements for opening an account for a 
business entity .  When opening an account for a customer that is not an individual, banks are 
permitted by 31 CFR 1020.100 to obtain information about the individuals who have 
authority and control over such accounts in order to verify the customer’s identity (the customer being  the business entity) .  Required account opening information may include 
articles of incorporation, a corporate resolution by the directors authorizing the opening of the account, or the appointment of a person to act as a signatory for the entity on the account.  Particular attention should be paid to articles of association that allow for nominee 
shareholders, board members, and bearer shares. 
If the bank, through its trust or private banking departments, is facilitating the establishment 
of a business en tity for a new or existing customer, the money laundering risk to the bank is 
typically mitigated .  Because the bank is aware of the parties (e.g ., grantors, beneficiaries, 
and shareholders) involved in the business entity, initial due diligence and verification is easier to obtain .  Furthermore, in such cases, the bank frequently has ongoing relationships 
with the customers initiating the establishment of a business entity.  
Risk assessments may include a review of the domestic or international jurisd iction where 
the business entity was established, the type of account (or accounts) and expected versus 
actual transaction activities, the types of products used, and whether the business entity was 
created in -house or externally.  If ownership is held in bearer share form, banks should assess 
the risks these relationships pose and determine the appropriate controls.  For example, in 
most cases banks should choose to maintain (or have an independent third party  maintain ) 
bearer shares for customers .  In rar e cases involving lower -risk, well -known, established  
customers, banks may find that periodically recertifying beneficial ownership is effective.  The bank’ s risk assessment of a business entity customer becomes more important in 
complex corporate formatio ns.  For example, a foreign IBC may establish a layered series of 
business entities, with each entity naming its parent as its beneficiary.  
Ongoing account monitoring is critical to ensure that the accounts are reviewed for unusual and suspicious activity.  The bank should be aware of higher -risk transactions in these

Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  320 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures  
Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
transactions involving domestic and foreign business entities, and management’ s ability to 
implement effective due diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems. 
1.Review the bank ’s policies, procedures, and pr ocesses related to business entities .
Evaluate the adequacy of the policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’ s
transactions with business entities and the risks they present.  Assess whether the controls
are adequate to reasonably protect the ban k from money laundering and terrorist
financing.
2. Review the policies and processes for opening and monitoring accounts with business
entities .  Determine whether the policies adequately assess the risk between different
account types.
3.Determine how t he bank identifies and, as necessary, completes additional due diligence
on business entities .  Assess the level of due diligence the bank performs when
conducting its risk assessment.
4.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors higher- risk business entity accounts.
5.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring business entities for suspicious
activities , and for reporting of suspicious activities, is adequate given the act ivities
associated with business entities.
6. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “ Office of Fo reign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance .
Transaction Testing  
7. On the basis of the bank’ s risk assessment of its accounts with business entities, as well
as prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of these accounts.  Include the
following risk factors:
•An entity organized in a higher- risk jurisdiction.
•Account activity that is substantially currency based.
•An entity whose account activity consists primarily of circular-patterned funds
transfers.
•A business entity whose ownership is in bearer shares, especially bearer shares  that
are not under bank or trusted third-party control.
•An entity that uses a wide range of bank  services, particularly trust and correspondent
services.
--- Page 326 ---
Business Entities (Domestic and Foreign) — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  321 2/27/2015.V2  •An entity owned or controlled by other nonpublic business entities.
•Business entities for which the bank has filed SARs.
8.From the sample selected, obtain a relationship report for each selected account .  It is
critical that the full relationship, rather than only an individual account, be reviewed.
9. Review the due diligence information on the business entity .  Assess the adequacy of that
information.
10.Review account statements and, as necessary, specific transaction details .  Compare
expected transactions with actual activity .  Determine whether actual activity is consistent
with the nature and stated purpose of the account and whether transactions appear
unusual or suspicious.  Areas that may  pose a higher  risk, such as funds transfers, private
banking, trust, and monetary instruments, should be a primary focus of the transaction
review.
11. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated withbusiness entity relationships.

Cash -Intensive Businesses — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  322 2/27/2015.V2  Cash-Intensive Businesses — Overview 
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
cash-intensive businesses and entities, and management’ s ability to implement effective due 
diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems. 
Cash -intensive businesses and entities cover various industry secto rs.  Most of these 
businesses are conducting legitimate business; however, some aspects of these businesses 
may be susceptible to money laundering or terrorist financing.  Common examples include, 
but are not limited to, the following:  
•Convenience stores.
•Restaurants.
•Retail stores.
•Liquor stores.
•Cigarette distributors.
•Privately owned  automated teller machines (ATM ).
•Vending machine operators.
•Parking garages.
Risk Factors  
Some businesses and entities may be misused by money launderers to legitimize their  illicit 
proceeds .  For example, a criminal may own a cash -intensive business, such as a restaurant, 
and use it to launder currency from illicit criminal activities .  The restaurant ’s currency 
deposits with its bank do not, on the surface, appear unusual because the business is 
legitimately a cash -generating entity .  However, the volume of currency in a restaurant used 
to launder money is  most likely be higher in comparison with similar restaurants in the area .  
The nature of cash -intensive businesses and t he difficulty in identifying unusual activity may 
cause these businesses to be considered higher  risk.  
Risk Mitigation  
When establishing and maintaining relationships with cash-intensive businesses, banks should establish policies, procedures, and processe s to identify higher- risk relationships; 
assess AML risks; complete due diligence at account opening and periodically throughout the relationship; and include such relationships in appropriate monitoring for unusual or suspicious activity.  At the time of account opening, the bank should have an understanding 
of the customer’s business operations; the intended use of the account; including anticipated transaction volume, products, and services used; and the geographic locations involved in the 
relationship. 
When conducting a risk assessment of cash-intensive businesses, banks should direct their 
resources to those accounts that pose the greatest risk of money laundering or terrorist 
financing .  The following factors may be used to identify the risks: 
--- Page 328 ---
Cash -Intensive Businesses — Overview  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  323 2/27/2015.V2  •Purpose of the account.
•Volume, frequency, and nature of currency transactions.
•Customer history (e.g., length of relationship, CTR filings,300 and SAR filings).
•Primary business activity, products, and services offered.
•Business or business structure.
•Geographic l ocations and jurisdictions of operations.
•Availability of information and cooperation of the business in providing information.
For those customers deemed to be particularly higher risk, bank management may consider 
implementing sound practices, such as periodic on- site visits, interviews with the business ’s 
management, or closer reviews of transactional activity.  
300 As discussed in the core overvi ew section, “Currency Transaction Reporting Exemptions ,” page 86 , certain 
entities are ineligible for currency transaction reporting exemptions as a non- listed business.

Cash -Intensive Businesses — Examination Procedures  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  324 2/27/2015.V2  Examination Procedures 
Cash-Intensive Businesses  
Objective.  Assess the adequacy of the bank’s systems to manage the risks associated with 
cash-intensive businesses and entities, and management’ s ability to implement effective due 
diligence, monitoring, and reporting systems. 
1.Review the policies, procedures, and processes related to cash -intensive businesses.
Evaluate the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes given the bank’ s cash -
intensive business activities in relation to the bank ’s cash -intensive business cus tomers
and the risks that they represent.  Assess whether the  controls are adequate to reasonably
protect the bank from money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.From  a review of MIS and internal risk rating factors, determine whether the bank
effectively identifies and monitors cash-intensive businesses and entities.
3.Determine whether the bank ’s system for monitoring cash-intensive businesses for
suspicious activities, and for reporting of suspicious activities, is adequate given the
bank’ s size, com plexity, location, and types of customer relationships.
4. If appropriate, refer to the core examination procedures, “ Office of Fo reign Assets
Control,” page 152, for guidance .
Transaction Testing  
5. On the basis of the bank’ s risk assessment of its cash-intensive business and entity
relationships, as well as prior examination and audit reports, select a sample of cash -
intensive businesses.  As an a lternat ive, identify branches in the bank’s highest- risk areas
or branches that ship/receive the most cash and request the largest sources and users of
cash at those locations.  From the sample selected, perform the following examination
procedures:
•Review account opening documentation including CIP information, if applicable, and
a sample of transaction act ivity.
•Determine whether actual account activity is consistent with anticipated account
activity.
•Look for trends in the nature, size, or scope of the transactions, paying particularattention to currency transactions.
•Determine whether ongoing monitoring is sufficient to identify potentially suspiciousactivity.
6. On the basis of examination procedures completed, including transaction testing, form a
conclusion about the adequacy of policies, procedures, and processes associated with
cash-intensive businesse s and entities.

Appendix E: International Organizations  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  E–1 2/27/2015.V2  Appendix E: International Organizations  
Money laundering and terrorist financing can have a wi despread international impact .  
Money launderers have been found to transfer funds and maintain assets on a global level, 
which makes tracing funds through various countries a complex and challenging process.  Most countries support the fight against money laundering and terrorist funding; however, because of the challenges in creating consistent laws or regulations between countries, international groups have developed model recommendations for governments and financial 
institutions .  Two key international bodies in this area follow: 
•The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)  is an
intergovernmental body established to set standards and promote implementation of
legal, regulatory and operational measures to combat money laundering, terroristfinancing  and other threats to the international financial system.  The FATF has
developed a series of recommendations on various money laundering and terrorist
financing issues .  First  published in 1990, the FATF Recommendations are frequently
revised to  ensure they remain up to date and relevant.
301
•T
he Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  is a committee of central banks and
bank supervisors and regulators from numerous jurisdictions that meets at the Bank forInternational Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Sw itzerland, to discuss issues related to
prudential banking supervision.  The Basel Committee formulates broad standards andguidelines and makes recommendations regarding sound practices, including those oncustomer due diligence.
In addition, other global  organizations are becoming increasingly involved in combating 
money laundering.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have integrated  AML and counter- terrorist financing issues into their financial sector assessments, 
surveillance, and  diagnostic activities .  Furthermore, various FATF-style regional bodies 
exist .  These groups participate as observers in FATF meetings; assess their members against 
the FATF standards; and, like FATF members, frequently provide input to the IMF  and 
World Bank assessment program. 
301 Another well -known FATF initiative is related to high risk and noncooperative countries.  FATF identifies 
and issues public statements on jurisdictions that are subject to countermeasures, and jurisdictions with AML 
deficiencies that have not made progress in addressing the deficiencies or have not committed to an action plan to address t he deficiencies.  The public statements can be found at the FATF Web site .  FinCEN
 issues 
corresponding guidance to banks operating in the United States of the money laundering and terrorist financing 
risks associated with jurisdictions identified by the FATF .

Appendix F: Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing “Red Flags”  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  F–1 2/27/2015.V2  Appendix F : Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing “Red 
Flags” 
The following are examples of potentially suspicious activities, or “ red flags ” for both money 
laundering and terrorist financing.  Although these lists are not all-inclusive, they may help 
banks and examiners recognize possible money laundering and terrorist financing schemes.  
FinCEN issues advisories containing examples of “red flags” to inform and assist banks in reporting instances of suspected money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud.  In order to assist law enforcement in its efforts to target these activities, FinC EN requests that banks 
check the appropriate box(es) in the Suspicious Activity Information section and include certain key terms in the narrative section of the SAR.  The advisories and guidance can be found on FinCEN W eb site.
302  Management ’s primary focu s should be on reporting 
suspicious activities, rather than on determining whether the transactions are in fact linked to 
money laundering, terrorist financing, or a particular crime.  
The following examples are red flags that, when encountered, may warrant additional 
scrutiny .  The mere presence of a red flag is not by itself evidence of criminal activity .  
Closer scrutiny should help to determine whether the activity is suspicious or one for which 
there does not appear to be a reasonable business or legal purpose. 
Potentially Suspicious Activity That May Indicate Money Laundering  
Customers Who Provide Insufficient or Suspicious Information  
•A customer uses unusual or suspicious identification documents that cannot be readily
verified.
•A customer provides an individual tax payer  identification number after having previously
used a Social Security number .
•A customer uses different tax payer  identification numbers with variations of his or her
name.
•A business is reluctant, when establishing a new account, to provide complete
information about the nature and purpose of its business, anticipated account activity,
prior banking relationships, the names of its officers and directors, or information on its
business location.
•A customer ’s home or business telephone is disconnected.
•The customer ’s background differs from that which would be expected on the basis of his
or her business activities.
•A customer makes frequent or large transactions and has no record of past or present
employment experience.
•A customer is a tru st, shell company, or Private Investment Company that is reluctant to
provide information on controlling parties and underlying beneficiaries.  Beneficial

bank accounts for those shell companies while shielding the owner’s identity. 
Efforts to Avoid Reporting or Recordkeeping Requirement  
•A customer or group tries to persuade a bank employee not to file required reports ormaintain required records.

which are subsequently consolidated into a master account and transferred outside of the
country, particularly to or through a location of specific concern (e.g., countriesdesignated by national authorities and Financial Action Task Force on Money
Laundering (FATF) as noncooperative countries and territories).
•A customer accesses a safe deposit box after completing a transaction involving a large
withdrawal of currency, or accesses a safe depos it box before making currency deposits
structured at or just under $10,000, to evade CTR  filing requirements.
Funds Transfers 
•Many funds transfers are sent in large, round dollar, hundred dollar, or thousand dollaramounts.
•Funds transfer activity occurs to or from a financial secrecy haven, or to or from a higher -
risk geographic location without an apparent business reason or when the activity is
inconsistent with the customer ’s business or history.
•Funds transfer activity occurs to or from a financial institution located in a higher risk
jurisdiction distant from the customer’s operations.
•Many small, incoming transfers of funds are received, or deposits are made using checksand money orders.  Almost immediately, all or most of the transfers or deposits are wired
to another city or country in a manner inconsistent with the customer’s business or
history.
•Large, incoming funds transfers are received on behalf of a foreign client, with little or no
explicit reason.
•Funds transfer activity is unexplained, repetitive, or shows unusual patterns.

The definition of structuring, as set forth in 31 CFR 1010.100 (xx) (which was implemente d 
before a USA PATRIOT  Act provision extended the prohibition on structuring to geographic 
targeting orders and BSA recordkeeping requirements) , states, “a person structures a 
transaction if that person, acting alone, or in conjunction with, or on behalf of, other persons, conducts or attempts to conduct one or more transactions in currency in any amount, at one or more financial institutions, on one or more days, in any manner, for the purpose of evading the [CTR filing requirements]. ” “In any manner ” incl udes, but is not limited to, 
breaking down a single currency sum exceeding $10,000 into smaller amounts that may be conducted as a series of transactions at or less than $10,000.  The transactions need not exceed the $10,000 CTR filing threshold at any one bank on any single day in order to 
constitute structuring.  
Money launderers and criminals have developed many ways to structure large amounts of 
currency to evade the CTR filing requirements .  Unless currency is smuggled out of the 
United States or commingled with the deposits of an otherwise legitimate business, any money laundering scheme that begins with a need to convert the currency proceeds of criminal activity into more legitimate -looking forms of financial instruments, accounts, or 
investments, is  likely  to involve some form of structuring.  Structuring remains one of the 
most commonly reported suspected crimes on SARs.  
Bank employees should be aware of and alert to structuring schemes.  For example, a 
customer may structure currency deposit or withdrawal transactions, so that each is less than the $10,000 CTR filing threshold; use currency to purchase official bank checks, money orders, or traveler’s checks with currency in amounts less than $10,000 (and possibly in amounts less than the $3,000 recordkeeping threshold for the currency purchase of monetary instruments to avoid having to produce identification in the process); or exchange small bank 
notes for large ones in amounts less than $10,000. 
However, two transactions slightly under the $10,000 threshold conducted days or weeks 
apart may not necessarily be structuring.  For example, if a customer deposits $9,900 in currency on Monday and deposits $9,900 in currency on Wednesday, it should not be assumed that structuring has occurred .  Instead, further review and research may be 
--- Page 356 ---
Appendix G: Structuring  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  G–2 2/27/2015.V2  necessary to determine the nature of the transactions, prior account history, and other 
relevant customer information to assess whether the activity is suspicious.  Even if 
structuring has not occurred, the bank should review the transactions for suspicious activity. 
In addition, structuring may occur before a customer brings the funds to a bank.  In these 
instances, a bank may be able to identify the aftermath of structuring.  Deposits of monetary 
instruments that may h ave been purchased elsewhere might be structured to evade the CTR 
filing requirements or the recordkeeping requirements for the currency purchase of monetary instruments .  These instruments are often numbered sequentially in groups totaling less than 
$10,000 or $3,000; bear the same handwriting (for the most part) and often the same small mark, stamp, or initials; or appear to have been purchased at numerous places on the same or 
different days.

Certain customer relationships may pose a higher risk than others.  This chart provides an example of how a bank 
may stratify the risk profile of its customers (see legend and risk levels).  Because the nature of the customer is 
only one variable in assessing risk, this simplified chart is for illustration purposes only.  The chart also illustrates 
the progressive methods of due diligence and suspicious activity monitoring systems that banks may deploy as the risk level rises.  (See Observed Methods, below.)

Appendix L: SAR Quality Guidance  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  L–1 2/27/2015.V2  Appendix L: SAR Quality Guidance 
The following information is provided as guidance.  Refer to  FinCEN ’s Suspicious Activity 
Report (FinCEN SAR) Electronic Filing Requirements, Release Date October 2012 , Version 
1.2.306  FinCEN’s instructions contain a checklist as a guide for preparing the narrative.  
FinCEN has requested banks include certain key terms in the narrative section of the SAR.  
A consolidated listing of SAR narrative key terms and a link to the related advisories and 
guidance can be found on FinCEN Web site.307  Banks also should consult Suggestions for 
Addressing Common Errors Noted in Suspicious Activity Reporting (October 10, 2007).308   
Often SARs have been instrumental in enabling law enforcement to initiate or supplement major money laundering or terrorist financing investigations and other crimi nal cases .  
Information provided in SARs  also allow FinCEN and the federal banking agencies to identify emerging trends and patterns associated with financial crimes .  The information 
about those trends and patterns is vital to law enforcement agencies and provides valuable 
feedback to financial institutions.  
Banks must file SAR s that are complete, sufficient, and timely .  Unfortunately, some banks 
file SAR s that contain incomplete, incorrect, or disorganized narratives, making further 
analysis difficult, if not impossible .  Because the SAR narrative serves as the only free text 
area for summarizing suspicious activity, the narrative section is “critical. ” The care with 
which the narrative is written may make the difference in whether or not the described 
conduct and its possible criminal nature are clearly understood by law enforcement, and thus a failure to adequately describe the factors making a transaction or activity suspicious 
undermines the purpose of the SAR. 
The SAR s  should include any information readily available to the filing bank obtained 
through the account opening process and due diligence efforts.  In general, a SAR narrative 
should identify the five essential elements of information ( who? what? when? where? and 
why? ) for the suspicious activity being reported .  The method of operation (or how? ) is also 
important and should be included in the narrative. 
Who is conducting the suspicious activity?  
While one section of the SAR  calls for specific suspect information, the narrative should be 
used to further describe the suspect or suspects, including occupation, position or title within the suspect’s business, the nature of the suspect’s business (or businesses), and any other 
information and identification numbers associated with the suspects. 
What instruments or mechanisms are being used to facilitate 
the suspect transactions?  
A list of instruments or mechanisms that may be used in suspicious activity includes, but is not limited to, funds transfers, letters of credit and other trade instrum ents, correspondent 
306 Refer to the FinCEN’s SAR Electronic Filing Instructions . 
307 Refer to the FinCEN’s SAR Advisory Key Terms . 
308 Refer to Suggestions for Addressing Common Errors Noted in Suspicious Activity Reporting  (October 10, 
2007 ).

Appendix L: SAR Quality Guidance  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  L–2 2/27/2015.V2  accounts, casinos, structuring, shell companies, bonds or notes, stocks, mutual funds, 
insurance policies, traveler ’s checks, bank drafts, money orders, credit or debit cards, prepaid  
cards, and digital currency business services .  The SAR includes a number of check boxes to 
record the instrument type(s)/payment mechanism (s) involved in the suspicious activity and 
type(s) of suspicious activity being reported.  FinCEN requests that banks check the 
appropriate box(es) in the Suspicious Activity Information section and include certain key terms in the narrative section of the SAR.  If necessary, the instrument and type of suspicious 
activity can be described in further detail in the narrative.  If a SAR narrative summarizes the 
flow of funds, the narrative should always include the source of the funds (origination) and 
the use, destination, or beneficiary of the funds. 
When did the suspicious activity take place?  
If the activity takes place over a period of time, indicate the date when the suspicious activity 
was first noticed and describe the duration of the activity.  When possible, in order to better track the flow of funds, individual dates and amounts of transactions should be included in 
the narrative rather than only the aggregated amount. 
Where did the suspicious activity take place?  
The narrative should indicate where the suspicious activity took place. .  The narrative should 
also specify if the suspected activity or transactions involves a foreign jurisdiction. 
Why does the filer think the activity is suspicious?  
The SAR should describe, as fully as possible, why the activity or transaction is unusual for 
the customer, considering the types of products and services offered by the filing bank’ s 
industry, and drawing any applicable contrasts with the nature and normally expected 
activities of similar customers.  
How did the suspicious activity occur?  
The narrative should describe the “modus operandi” or the method of operation of the subject 
conducting the suspicious activity.  In a concise, accurate, and logical manner, the narrative 
should describe how the suspect transaction or pattern of transactions was committed.  For example, if what appears to be structuring of currency deposits is matched with outgoing funds transfers from the accounts, the SAR narrative should include information about both 
the structuring and outbound transfers (including dates, destinations, amounts, accounts, 
frequency, and beneficiaries of the funds transfers). 
Supporting Documentation 
Filers can include a single, Microsoft Excel file with no more than one megabyte of dat a as 
an attachment to the SAR.  This file would be most suitable for documenting transaction 
records that are too numerous to record in Part V.  Do not include any other supporting documentation with the SAR.  Instead, describe in Part V other supporting documentation not included in the spreadsheet.  Filers must retain all supporting documentation or a business record equivalent for five (5) years from the date of the report.  All supporting 
documentation must be made available to appropriate authorities upon request.

letters, or civil money penalties, with evidence that the bank 
addressed the issues and is not at 
risk of similar violations in the 
future.  Multiple recent actions by 
OFAC, where the bank has  not

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  O–1 2/27/2015.V2  Appendix O: Examiner Tools for  
Transaction Testing  
Currency Transaction Reporting  and Suspicious Activity Reporting  
If the bank does not have preset filtering reports for currency transaction reporting and the 
identification of suspicious currency transactions, the examiner should consider requesting a custom report.  For example, a report could be generated with the following criteria: currency transactions of $7,000 or higher (in and out) for the preceding period ( to be determined by 
the examiner ) before the date of examination .  The time period covered and the transaction 
amounts may be adjusted as determined by the examiner .  The report should also capture: 
•The customer information file (CIF) number, if available, or Social Security number
(SSN)/ taxpayer identification number (TIN).
•The date, amount, and account number of each transaction.
•The teller and branch or other applicable identifying information.
This data should be prepared in an electronic spreadsheet or database format to facilitate the 
sorting of the data.  The data can be sorted in a number of different criteria (e.g., by branch, by teller, by SSN/TIN, or CIF number, if available) .  Analysis of this information should 
enable the examiner to determine whether CTRs and SARs have been ap propriately filed.  
Funds Transfer Monitoring  
If the bank does not have preset filtering reports for funds transfer record keeping and the identification of suspicious transactions, the examiner should consider requesting a custom report .  The examiner may consider requesting that the bank provide a report from its funds 
transfer systems that identifies all funds transfers (in and out) for a time period determined by 
the examiner .  The report should also capture: 
•The customer ’s full name, country of residence, SSN/TIN, and BSA/AML risk rating, if
applicable.
•The date, amount, transaction type, and account number of each transaction.
•The originator’s name, country, financial institution, and account number.
•The beneficiary ’s name, country, financial institution, and account number.
The bank should provide a list of bank internal codes necessary to fully identify the account 
type, BSA/AML risk rating, country, transaction type, bank number, account number, and any other codes on the electronic reports .  The list  should be sorted to identify those accounts 
that do not contain sufficient originator or beneficiary information.  Missing information may indicate funds transfer monitoring deficiencies.  A large number of transfers or those of high-dollar amounts to and from higher-risk jurisdictions or involving parties that do not appear 
likely to be involved in such transactions may indicate the need for additional scrutiny.

Appen dix O: Examiner Tools for Transaction Testing  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  O–2 2/27/2015.V2  Adequacy of Deposit Account Information and 
Trust and Asset Management Account Information  
This test is designed to ensure that the bank is in compliance with the CIP regulatory 
requirements and to test the adequacy of the bank’s CDD policies, procedures, and processes. 
The examiner should request an electronic list (spreadsheet or database) of al l deposit 
accounts and trust/asset management accounts as of the date of examination .  The balances 
should be reconciled to the general ledger.  The report should also capture: 
•The customer ’s full name, date of birth, address, country of residence, SSN/TIN, and
BSA/AML risk rating, if applicable.
•The date the account was opened.
•The average daily balance (during the review period) and balance of the account as of the
examination date.
The bank should provide a list of bank internal codes necessary to fully identify the account type, BSA/AML risk rating, country, transaction type, branch number, teller number, and any other codes found on the electronic reports.  The list should be sorted to identify those 
accounts that do not contain sufficient information. 
Testing of Currency -Shipment Logs for Unusual Activity  
Review all, or a sample, of the bank’ s currency -shipment logs for significant aberrations or 
unusual patterns of currency- shipment activity .  Examiners may also consider reviewing the 
FDIC Summary of Deposits (SOD) data for unusual trends in branch deposit growth. 
Assess whether shipment levels and the frequency of shipments appear commensurate with 
the expected bank and branch activity levels .  This assessment should include transactions to 
and from the central currency vault and the branches .  Unusual activity warranting further 
research may include significant exchanges of small -denomination bills for large-
denomination bills and significant requests for large bills.  
Nonresident Aliens  and Foreign Ind ividuals 
An effective method to identify and review the level of the bank’s nonresident aliens (NRA), foreign individuals, and offshore corporations is by obtaining MIS  reports that provide no 
TINs or accountholders with individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITIN).  The report 
should capture: 
•Customer’s full name, date of birth, address, country of residence, and SSN/TIN.
•Date the account was opened.
•Average daily balance and balance of the account as of the examination date.
This data should be prepared in an electronic spreadsheet or database format to facilitate the 
sorting of the data.  The bank should provide a list of bank internal codes necessary to fully identify the information on the spreadsheet.  This information can be used to assess whether the amount of NRAs and foreign individuals provide heightened risk to the bank by 
--- Page 385 ---
Appen dix O: Examiner Tools for Transaction Testing  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  O–3 2/27/2015.V2  determining the aggregate average daily balance, the account types, and countries in  which 
the bank is exposed. 
Funds Flow Reports 
Examiners can review this information to identify customers with a high velocity of funds 
flow and those with unusual activity.  A velocity of funds report reflects the total debits and credits flowing through  a particular account over a specific period (e.g., 30 days).  The 
electronic reports should capture:  
•Name of customer.
•Account number.
•Date of transaction.
•Dollar amount of payments (debits).
•Dollar amount of receipts (credits).
•Average balance of the account.
•Type of account.
This data should be prepared in an electronic spreadsheet or database format to facilitate the sorting of the data.  This report can be used to identify customer accounts with substantial 
funds flow relative to other accounts.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  P–1 2/27/2015.V2  Appendix P: BSA Record- Retention Requirements  
This appendix is provided as a summary listing .  For comprehensive and current BSA 
record -retention requirements, refer to U.S. Treasury/FinCEN regulations found at 31 CFR 
Chapter X.  These BSA record -retention requirements are independent of and in addition to 
record -retention requirements under other laws. 
Five-Year Retention for Records as Specified B elow 
The BSA establishes recordkeeping requirements related to various types of records 
including: customer accounts (e.g., loan, deposit, or trust), BSA filing requirements, and records that document a bank’ s compliance with the BSA .  In general, the BSA requires that 
a bank maintain most records for at least five years.  These records can be maintained in many forms including original, microfilm, electronic, copy, or a reproduction .  A b ank is not 
required to keep a separate system of records for each of the BSA requirements; however, a bank must maintain all records in a way that makes them accessible in a reasonable period of 
time. 
The records related to the transactions discussed below must be retained by a bank for five 
years .  However, as noted below, the records related to the identity of a bank customer must 
be maintained for five years after the account (e.g., loan, deposit, or trust) is closed .  
Additionally, on a case- by-case bas is (e.g., U.S. Treasury Department Order, or law 
enforcement investigation), a bank may be ordered or requested to maintain some of these 
records for longer periods.

Interagency Statement on Enforcement of Bank Secrecy Act/Anti -Money 
Laundering Requirements309 
This interagency statement, jointly issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,  and the National Credit Union Administration
310 sets forth the Agencies’ policy 
on the circumstances in which an Agency will issue a cease and  desist order to address 
noncompliance with certain Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) requirements,
311 particularly in light of the specific BSA/AML compliance provisions in 
section 8(s) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) and section 206(q) of the Federal 
Credit Union Act (FCUA).312  
BSA/AML Compliance Program Requirement. 
Under section 8(s) of the FDIA and section 206(q) of the FCUA, each of the Agencies is 
directed to prescribe regulations requiring each insured depository institution to establish and maintain procedures reasonably designed to assure and monitor the institution’s compliance with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA Compliance Program).  Sections 8(s) and 206(q) also require that each Agency’s examinations of an insured depository institution review the BSA Compliance Program and that its reports of examination describe any problem with the BSA Compliance Program.  Finally, sections 8(s) and 206(q) state that if an insured depository institution has failed to establish and maintain a BSA Compliance Program or has failed to correct any problem with the BSA Compliance Program previously reported to the institution by the appropriate Agency, the appropriate Agency shall issue a cease and desist order against the inst itution .  As required by sections 8(s) and 206(q), each 
of the Agencies has issued regulations that require any institution it supervises or insures to establish and maintain a BSA Compliance Program.  Each of these regulations imposes substantially the sa me requirements.
313 Specifically, under each Agency’s regulations, a BSA 
Compliance Program must have, at a minimum, the following elements:  
309 This statement is intended to set forth general policy guidance.  It is not intended to compel or preclude an 
enforcement or other supervisory action as necessary in a specific factual situation.  
310 Collectively the “Agencies” or individually the “Agency.”  
311 This statement does not address the assessment of civil money penalties for violations of the BSA or its 
implementing regulations.  FinCEN has authority to assess such penalties under the BSA.  Likewise, the 
Agencies also have such authority under their general enforcement statutes.  12 USC 1818(i)(2), 1786(k)(2).  
312 12 USC 1818(s); 12 USC 1786(q).  
313 12 CFR 21.21 (OCC); 208.63 (Board of Governors); 326.8(c) (FDIC); 748.2 (NCUA).  The provisions of 
section 8(s) are also made applicable to certain banking organizations other than insured depository institutions.  12 USC 1818(b)(3), (b)(4).  The OCC’s regulations also apply to federa l branches and agencies of foreign 
banks.  12 USC 3102(b); 12 CFR 28.13.  The Federal Reserve’s regulations also apply to Edge and agreement corporations, and branches, agencies, and other offices of foreign banking organizations.  12 CFR 211.5, 
211.24.  B SA Compliance Programs that comply with these Agency regulations are also deemed to comply with 
Treasury regulations issued pursuant to the BSA, which separately requires that financial institutions establish 
AML programs.  Refer to 31 CFR 1020.210; 31 USC  5318(h).  
--- Page 396 ---
Appendix R: Enforcement Guidance  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  R–2 2/27/2015.V2  •A system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance with the BSA;
•Independent testing for BSA/AML compliance;
•A designated individual or individuals responsible for coordinating and monitoring
BSA/AML compliance ; and
•Training for appropriate personnel.
In addition, a BSA Compliance Program must include a CIP  with risk -based procedures that 
enable the institution to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its 
customers.314 
Communication of Supervisory Concerns about BSA Compliance Programs . 
When an Agency identifies supervisory concerns relating to a banking organization’s or 
credit union’s BSA Compliance Program in the course of an examination or otherwise, the Agency may communicate those concerns by various means.  The particular method of communication used typically depends on the seriousness of the concerns.  These methods 
include: 
•Informal  discussions by examiners with an institution’s management during the
examination process ;
•Formal discussions by examiners with the board of directors as part of or following the
examination process ;
•Supervisory letters and other written communications from examiners or the agency to aninstitution’s management ;
•A finding contained in the report of examination or in other formal communications from
an Agency to an institution’s board of directors indicating deficiencies or weaknesses in
the BSA Compliance P rogram ; or
•A finding contained in the report of examination or in other formal communications from
the Agency to an institution’s board of directors of a violation of the regulatory
requirement to implement and maintain a reasonably designed BSA Compliance
Program.
As explained below, in order to be a “problem” with the BSA Compliance Program that will 
result in a cease and desist order under sections 8(s) or 206(q) if not corrected by the institution, deficiencies in the BSA Compliance Program must be identified in a report of 
examination or other written document as requiring communication to an institution’s board of directors or senior management as matters that must be corrected .  However, other issues 
or suggestions for improvement may be communicated through other means.  
314 12 CFR 21.21(b)(2) (OCC); 12 CFR 208.63(b)(2), 12 CFR 211.5(m)(2), 12 CFR 211.24(j)(2), (Board of 
Governors); 12 CFR 326.8(b)(2) (FDIC); 12 CFR 748.2(b)(2) (NCUA); 12 CFR 31 CFR 1020.220 (FinCEN).

Appendix R: Enforcement Guidance  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  R–3 2/27/2015.V2  Enforcement Actions for BSA Compliance Program Failures.  
In accordance with sections 8(s)(3) and 206(q)(3), the appropriate Agency will issue a cease 
and desist order against a banking organization or a credit union for noncompliance with BSA Compliance Program requirements in the following circumstances, based on a careful 
review of all the relevant facts and circumstances.  
Failure to establish and maintain a reasonably designed BSA Compliance Program.  
The appropriate Agency will issue a cease and desist order based on a violation of the 
requirement in sections 8(s) and 206(q) to establish and maintain a reasonably designed BSA 
Program where the institution:  
•Fails to have a written BSA Compliance Program, including a CIP  that adequ ately covers
the required program elements (i.e., internal controls, independent testing, designatedcompliance personnel, and training) ; or
•Fails to implement a BSA Compliance Program that adequately covers the required
Program elements (institution -issue d policy statements alone are not sufficient; the
program as implemented must be consistent with the banking organization’s written
policies, procedures, and processes) ; or
•Has defects in its BSA Compliance Program in one or more program elements that
indicate that either the written Compliance Program or its implementation is not
effective, for example, where the deficiencies are coupled with other aggravating factors,
such as (i) highly suspicious activity creating a significant potential for unreported moneylaundering or terrorist financing, (ii) patterns of structuring to evade reportingrequirements, (iii) significant insider complicity, or (iv) systemic failures to file CTR s,
SAR s, or other required BSA reports.
315
F
or example, an institution that has procedures to provide BSA/AML training to appropriate 
personnel, independent testing, and a designated BSA/AML compliance officer, would nonetheless be subject to a cease and desist order if its system of internal controls (such as customer due diligence, procedures for monitoring suspicious activity, or an appropriate risk assessment) fails with respect to a higher risk area or to multiple lines of business that 
significantly impact the institution’s overall BSA compliance .  Similarly, a cease and desist 
order would be warranted if, for example, an institution has deficiencies in the required independent testing element of the Program and those deficiencies are coupled with evidence of highly suspicious activity creating a significant potential for unreported money laundering or terrorist financing in the institution .  However, other types of deficiencies in an 
institution’s BSA Compliance Program or in implementation of one or more of the required Program elements will not necessarily result in the issuanc e of a cease and desist order, 
unless the deficiencies are so severe as to render the Program ineffective when viewed as a whole.  For example, an institution that has deficiencies in its procedures for providing BSA/AML training to appropriate personnel, but has effective controls, independent testing, and a designated BSA/AML compliance officer, may ordinarily be subject to examiner criticism and/or supervisory action other than the issuance of a cease and desist order, unless 
315 These examples do not in any way limit the ability of an Agency to bring an enforcement action where the 
failure to have or to implement a BSA Compliance Program is demonstrated by other deficiencies.  
--- Page 398 ---
Appendix R: Enforcement Guidance  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  R–4 2/27/2015.V2  the training program deficie ncies, viewed in light of all relevant circumstances, are so severe 
as to result in a finding that the organization’s Program, taken as a whole, is not effective. 
In determining whether an organization has failed to implement a BSA Compliance Program, 
an A gency will also consider the application of the organization’s Program across its 
business lines and activities .  In the case of institutions with multiple lines of business, 
deficiencies affecting only some lines of business or activities would need to be evaluated to determine if the deficiencies are so severe or significant in scope as to result in a conclusion 
that the institution has not implemented an effective overall program.  
Failure to correct a previously reported problem with the BSA Compliance Program .  
A history of deficiencies in an institution’s BSA Compliance Program in a variety of 
different areas, or in the same general areas, may result in a cease and desist order on that basis .  An Agency will, in accordance with sections 8(s) and 206(q), and based on a careful 
review of the relevant facts and circumstances, issue a cease and desist order whenever an institution fails to correct a problem with BSA/AML compliance identified during the supervisory process.  In order to be considered a “probl em” within the meaning of sections 
8(s)(3)(B) and 206(q)(3)(B), however, a deficiency reported to the institution ordinarily would involve a serious defect in one or more of the required components of the institution’s BSA Compliance Program or implementation thereof that a report of examination or other 
written supervisory communication identifies as requiring communication to the institution’s 
board of directors or senior management as a matter that must be corrected .  For example, 
failure to take any act ion in response to an express criticism in an examination report 
regarding a failure to appoint a qualified compliance officer could be viewed as an 
uncorrected problem that would result in a cease and desist order. 
An Agency will ordinarily not issue a cease and desist order under sections 8(s) or 206(q) for 
failure to correct a BSA Compliance Program problem unless the deficiencies subsequently found by the Agency are substantially the same as those previously reported to the institution .  For example, if  an Agency notes in one examination report that an institution’s 
training program was inadequate because it was out of date (for instance if it did not reflect changes in the law), and at the next examination the training program is adequately updated, but flaws are discovered in the internal controls for the BSA/AML Program, the Agency may determine not to issue a cease and desist order under sections 8(s) or 206(q) for failure to correct previously reported problems and will consider the full range of potential supervisory responses.  Similarly, if an institution is cited in an examination report described above for failure to designate a qualified BSA compliance officer, and the institution by the next examination has appointed an otherwise qualified person to assume that responsibility, but the examiners recommend additional training for the person, an Agency may determine not to issue a cease and desist order under sections 8(s) or 206(q) based solely on that deficiency.  Statements in a written examination report or other supervisory communication identifying less serious issues or suggesting areas for improvement that the examination report does not identify as requiring communication to the board of directors or senior management as matters that must b e corrected would not be considered “problems” for purposes of sections 
8(s) and 206(q). 
The Agencies recognize that certain types of problems with an institution’s BSA Compliance 
Program may not be fully correctable before the next examination, for example, remedial 
--- Page 399 ---
Appendix R: Enforcement Guidance  
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  R–5 2/27/2015.V2  action involving adoption or conversion of computer systems.  In these types of situations, a 
cease and desist order is not required provided the Agency determines that the institution has made acceptable substantial progress toward correcting the problem at the time of the examination immediately following the examination where the problem was first identified 
and reported to the institution. 
Other enforcement actions for BSA Compliance Program deficiencies .  As noted above, 
in addition to the situations described in this Statement where an Agency will issue a cease 
and desist order for a violation of the BSA Compliance Program regulation or for failure to correct a previously reported Program “problem,” an Agency may also issue a cease and desist order or enter into a formal written agreement, or take informal enforcement action 
against an institution for other types of BSA/AML Program concerns.  In these situations, depending upon the particular facts involved, an Agency may pursue enforcement actions based on unsafe and unsound practices or violations of law, including the BSA.  The form of the enforcement action in a particular case will depend on the severity of the noncompliance, weaknesses, or deficiencies, the capability and cooperation of  the institution’s management, 
and the Agency’s confidence that the institution will take appropriate and timely corrective 
action.   
BSA Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements  
Suspicious activity reporting requirements .  Under regulations of the Agencies and the 
Treasury Department, organizations subject to the Agencies’ supervision are required to file 
a SAR  when they detect certain known or suspected criminal violations or suspicious 
transactions.316 Suspicious activity reporting forms the cornerstone of the BSA reporting 
system, and is critical to the United States’ ability to utilize financial information to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.  The regulations require banking organizations and credit unions to file S ARs with respect to the following general 
types of activity:  
•Known or suspected criminal violations involving insider activity in any amount;
•Known or suspected criminal violations aggregating $5,000 or more when a suspect can
be identified;
•Known or suspected criminal violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of
potential suspects; or
•Suspicious transactions of $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or
BSA violations.
The SAR must be filed within 30 days of detecting facts tha t may constitute a basis for filing 
a SAR (or within 60 days if there is no subject).

Appendix T: BSA E -Filing System 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–1 2/27/2015.V2  Appendix T: BSA E-Filing System  
The information in this Appendix is based on FinCEN’s BSA E-Filing System Supervisory 
User Manual (Version 2.8, June 2014) and BSA E-Filing User Manual (Version 3.9, June 2014).  The information is subject to change as FinCEN updates its manuals.  Banks have access to the most recent version through FinCEN’s E- Filing System if questions arise.   
Please direct all inquiries to the FinCEN Resource Center by calling the toll- free number 
(800) 767-2825 or (703) 905-3591 or by e- mailing your inquiry to FRC@fincen.gov
. 
The BSA E -Filing System provides for: 
•Electronic filing of BSA forms (both individual (discrete) and in batches); receive
acknowledgements; and track t he submission status of filin gs;
•Receiv ing Alerts from FinCEN ; and
•Send ing Secure Messages to FinCEN and the ability to receive replies to those messages.
The management of these functions within the context of each bank is controlled by one or 
more Supervisory Users, who are designated by the bank.  The Supervisory Users may be assigned and/or confirmed by senior management (Chief Compliance Officer or equi valent). 
The Supervisory User should be the person or persons with primary responsibility for the bank’s use of the BSA E-Filing System.  Supervisory Users should be in a position to have insight into all of the BSA filing activities across the entire ban k.  They should be 
knowledgeable about the individuals responsible for preparing and submitting BSA filings 
and the processes by which filings are submitted.   
Supervisory Users have privileges to: 
•Request User IDs for new users within their bank;
•Assign BSA E -Filing roles to enrolled users;
•Delete user’s access to the BSA E -Filing System;
•Manage the bank -specific information contained in the system (such as address, EIN,
primary federal regulator); and
•Track all filings submitted by all users within the ir bank.
The following are the basic types of user filings permitted through the BSA E- Filing System:  
•Discrete Filer of BSA Forms.  These users file single BSA forms to FinCEN.
•Batch Filer of BSA Forms.  These users file multiple BSA forms in one electro nic batch
in accordance with the requirements outlined in FinCEN’s BSA E- Filing Electronic
Filing Requirements.
Through the assignment of predefined roles, Supervisory Users will control how their bank’s 
users can interact with the BSA E -Filing System.  A BSA E -Filing System user may be 
assigned a single or multiple filer roles.  The process of assigning roles will be required each 
--- Page 403 ---
Appendix T: BSA E -Filing System 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–2 2/27/2015.V2  time a new user is enrolled and will be required as users switch positions within the bank or 
take on additional responsibilities.  User’s roles should be removed from the BSA E- Filing 
System if they either transfer positions or leave the bank.  If a Supervisory User switches positions or leaves the bank, the Supervisory User will need to transfer Supervisory User 
responsibilities  to another individual or individuals.   
The BSA E -Filing roles are defined as follows:  
Filer Roles  Capabilities  
DISCRETE FILER ROLES  
FinCEN CTR Filer  Allows users to access, complete, and submit the discrete CTR . 
FinCEN Designation of Exempt 
Person(s)  (DO EP) Filer  Allows users to access, comple te, and submit discrete DOEP 
report .  
FinCEN SAR Filer  Allows users to access, complete, and submit the discrete SAR . 
FinCEN FBAR Filer  Allows users to access, complete, a nd submit the discrete FBAR . 
BATCH FILER ROLES  
FinCEN CTR Batch Filer  Allows submission of CTR batch files  
FinCEN SAR Batch Filer  Allows submission of SAR batch files. 
FinCEN DEP Batch Filer  Allows submission of DEP batch files.  
FinCEN FBAR Batch Filer  Allows submission of FBAR batch files.  
OTHER ROLES  
Secure Messenger  Allows users to send secure messages to FinCEN and receive 
secure replies. BSA report  acknowledgements are distributed via 
Secure  
Messaging, so this role should be assigned in conjunction with the 
user’s assigned filing role(s).  Every user must be a Secure 
Messenger  in order to obtain a PIN, which is used to electronically 
sign a BSA report prior to submission.  
Alerts Receiver  Allows users to  receive broadcast messages distributed by 
FinCEN.  
Secure Data Transfer Mode (SDTM) Batch Filer  Allows users to monitor and review SDTM submissions.  
A
 single user role assigned for “FinCEN CTR Filer,” will only allow the user access to 
discrete CTRs; access to other features or reports in the BSA E-Filing System would not be 
permitted.  When a BSA E-Filing user is assigned a filing role (e.g., FinCEN CTR Filer or FinCEN Batch Filer), they should also be given access to Secur e Messenger because the 
BSA r eport  acknowledgements are distributed via Secure Messaging.   
Report Submission 
Upon the successful submission of a discrete BSA report, a confirmation page will be 
presented, which will confirm the: 
•Tracking ID (A unique receipt number assigned to the fi le by the BSA E -Filing System).
Note: the Tracking ID number is different from the BSA Identification Number (BSA -
ID) utilized in the FinCEN Quer y System;
•Date and time of the submission ;
--- Page 404 ---
Appendix T: BSA E -Filing System 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–3 2/27/2015.V2  •Submission type;
•Owner (submitter) Name ; and
•Owner (submitter) e-mail address .
Banks may print the confirmation page for bank records and/or save the confirmation page as 
an HTML or PDF file.  The following is an example of a confirmation page for a discrete 
filing.  
U
pon a successful batch submission, a confirmation page will be presented confirming: 
•Tracking ID (a unique receipt number assigned to the file by the BSA E- Filing System).
Note: the Tracking ID number is different from the BSA -ID, utilized in the FinCEN
Query System;
•Receive Date/Time (the date and time that the file was submitted on BSA E -Filing) ;
•Submission type;
•Number of forms reported ;
•Owner (submitter) Name ;
•Owner (submitter) e -mail address; and
•Filing Name .

Banks may  print the confirmation page for bank records and/or save the confirmation page as 
an HTML or PDF file.  The following is an example of a confirmation page for a batch filing. 
T
racking the Status of Filings  
The Track Status feature allows a user to determine the status of a particular BSA filing in 
the routing process to FinCEN.  The Track Status screen shows tracking information at a batch level for batch filings and at an individual level for discrete filings.  As of July 1, 2011, 
the filing history will appear along with the filing ’s status for the past 1825 days (i.e. 5 years ) 
in the Track Status screen.  It may require up to ten minutes after submission for a filing’s 
information to appear on the Track Status screen, and longer for large files.   
BS
A E-Filing users will only be able to track the filings they have personally submitted.  
However, Supervisory Users are able to track all the filings submitted by all of their bank’s 
authorized users.  Supervisory Users cannot see the content of submissions.  They can only 
see the status of submissions.   
The tracking statuses for the successful routing of discrete and batch BSA filings (CTRs, 
SARs, DEPs, FBARs) to FinCEN include: 
Received.   The filing has been received by BSA E -Filing System, but has not yet been 
validated.  
Accepted.   The BSA E -Filing System has completed the validation process and accepted the 
filing.  
Transmitted.  The filing has been transmitted by the BSA E- Filing System to FinCEN.  
Acknowledged.  FinCEN has sent an acknowledgement to BSA E- Filing System and the BSA 
E-Filing System has sent that acknowledgement to the user.  Acknowledgements are sent via 
--- Page 406 ---
Appendix T: BSA E -Filing System 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–5 2/27/2015.V2  Secure Messaging to the submitting user.  Acknowledgements are only available to batch 
filers,  if the bank’s Supervisory User has enrolled the bank to receive batch 
acknowledgements.   
The tracking statuses that indicate errors for filings are as follows:  
•A
ccepted with Warnings .  This status only applies to batch filing.  The submission has
been accepted and will be processed by FinCEN.  However it contains some errors that
need to be corrected, once the submission has been acknowledged.  The warnings may be
reviewed through the Submission Warnings page.  The filer can also optionally downloadthe warnings by clicking on the Download as XML button to receive full detail of the
warnings.  The Submission Warnings  page provides important details concerning the
types of errors received and the location within the submitted file associated with theerror.  The column titled “Context” provides the location within the submitted file wherethe error was generated.  This field will often list the record type, field description, linenumber, and document number (if applicable).  The document number is equal to thetransaction sequence number for each document within a batch submission.  The firstdocument within the batch will have transaction sequence number “00001” and will
increment by one for each additional document.
•Transmitted with Warnings .  This status only applies to batch filing.  When a submission
that was previously “Accepted With Warnings” is transmitted to FinCEN, the statusbecomes “Transmitted with Warnings.” The user can click on the transmitted withwarnings link to view the warnings that were issued for the submission; however, thebank must wait until they receive the “Acknowledgement” file from FinCEN in order tocorrect and resubmit their batch submission.  The bank must wait for theAcknowledgement file because a BSA -ID is required for corrected submissions.  The
BSA -ID is not assigned until the file has been “Acknowledged.”

--- Page 407 ---
Appendix T: BSA E -Filing System 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–6 2/27/2015.V2  •Rejected.  This status applies to both discrete and batch filing.  Both types of submissions
(discrete and batch) will receive a status of “Rejected ” when an inva lid report version is
used or the role has not been assigned to the user.  Batch submissions will also receive a
“Rejected” status if the batch fails to meet the BSA Electronic Filing Requirements uponsubmission to the BSA E- Filing system.  The “Rejected” link in the Track Status
provides a listing of the file errors to be corrected.  Users have the option of correctingthe identified errors in a batch file due to data and/or format issues before resubmittingthe file, or users can resubmit the same batch file (without correcting the identified
errors) with the override option applied if the batch file has no “Fatal” errors.  If the batchfile has one or more “Fatal” errors, then the file must be corrected and the override option
cannot be applied.
•Acknow ledge Failed.  This status only applies to batch filing.  FinCEN was unable to
load the batch filing.  Therefore, an acknowledgement file could not be generated.
•Hold.  This status applies to both discrete and batch filing.  The filing was placed on Holdby the system administrator.

FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–7 2/27/2015.V2  Acknowledgement Notificaton 
When BSA E- Filing receives acknowledgements from FinCEN for filings, the filer will 
receive an e -mail containing a link to BSA E -Filing as well as the Secure Message ID that 
contains their acknowledgement.  The user must access BSA E -Filing to view the 
acknowledgment content.  The Secure Message subject field will include the filing tracking 
ID assigned to the filing upon submission in order to reconcile the acknowledgement with the submitte d filings.  The text box of the Secure Message will contain the Acknowledgement 
content for the discrete filing, as shown in the following graphic. 

--- Page 409 ---
Appendix T: BSA E -Filing System 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–8 2/27/2015.V2  A batch filing acknowledgement will arrive as an attachment to a Secure Message as shown 
in the foll owing graphic.

Appendix T: BSA E -Filing System 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–9 2/27/2015.V2  Storing Acknowledgements for Your Records  
BSA E -Filing retains information for a limited time.  For this reason, it is recommended that 
banks download and store acknowledgements for their permanent records.  Discrete filing 
acknowledgements may be saved as a PDF file and batch filing acknowledgements may be 
saved as separate attachments.  
BSA E -Filing Administrative Data Retention Policy:  
Administrative Data Type Retention Time  
Acknowledgement Data  30 days after being opened or 60 days after being posted, whichever 
comes first  
Alert Data  30 days after posting  
Track Status Data  As of July 1, 2011, 1825 days (i.e. 5 years) after achieving ‘Accepted’ or 
‘Rejected’ status. Note: The retention period prior to July 1, 2011 was 365 
days.  
E
rror Categories 
Discrete Filing Errors  
Discrete filing reports have been designed to prevent most errors.  If a filer submitting a 
report leaves certain fields blank (such as those fields noted with an *), the discrete report will not transmit.  These err ors would be comparable to a batch filer’s primary errors.  
Similarly, secondary errors (such as invalid zip codes), will also prevent the report from transmitting.  If a filer attempts to validate a report that contains errors, the filer will get a messag e saying, “There are validation errors.”  A separate window containing up to seven (7) 
errors will appear.  If more than seven (7) errors are detected, the window will record the number of additional errors in the report and note through a statement such a s “Message limit 
exceeded.  Remaining X errors not reported.”  The system will not allow submission until 
these remaining errors are remedied.   
A discrete report is validated for errors upon submission.  Once accepted and acknowledged 
by the system, only the BSA ID assigned for the filing is returned to the filer.  No additional 
errors are sent back along with acknowledgement message for discrete filing.  
Batch Filing Errors 
There are two types of errors identified in batch files: format errors that may result in 
automatic rejection of a batch file and file errors that represent errors in data entered in individual fields.  Fatal format errors prevent the batch file from being processed.  For example, error F18 “A required 9Z record is missing from the subm itted file” is a fatal 
format error because each batch file must contain a 9Z record.  Error C404, for a CTR filing, “Person street address is blank” is a file error because it indicates data is missing from a 
street address field.  For a SAR filing, error  S224 “Financial institution type is blank” is a file 
error because it indicates data is missing from a record.  A batch file with large numbers of 
file errors can be rejected by the BSA E -Filing Program if the number of errors exceeds 
programming limits.  
--- Page 411 ---
Appendix T: BSA E -Filing System 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–10 2/27/2015.V2  File errors are classified as primary or secondary errors, depending on their importance.  
Primary errors are file errors that violate electronic filing requirements or report instructions and so degrade data quality that they must be corrected.  Primary errors make it difficult for regulators, analysts, and law enforcement investigators to locate the reports in the database or identify the nature and circumstances of the filing.  Examples of such errors include blank last names or legal names, missing financial institution Employer Identification Numbers, or invalid entries in the transaction date field.  Attachment A – Error Code List identifies 
primary errors by adding an asterisk (*) to the four digit error code. 
Secondary errors are file errors that vio late electronic filing requirements or report 
instructions but have a lesser impact on data quality.  Examples of secondary errors are ZIP 
Codes that end in four zeroes (e.g. 123450000), blank or invalid financial institution address 
information, or invalid telephone numbers. 
Error Correction  
A detailed description of error codes can be found in Attachment A - Error Code List in the 
FinCEN Currency Transaction Report Electronic Filing Requirements and the FinCEN 
Suspicious Activity Report Electronic Filing Requirements.  
Attachment B – Error Correction Instructions are also contained in the Electronic Filing 
Requirements documents and identify the requirements and procedures for correcting FinCEN errors reported to batch filers during the FinCEN acknowledgement process. 
There are also batch file specifications for the FinCEN DOEP and the FinCEN FBAR in the 
Electronic Filing Requirements documents for those types of submissions.   
Correction Requirements  
Filers should immediately correct and resubmit a batch file rejected for fatal errors or for 
large numbers of file errors when notified by FinCEN the batch file was not accepted.  Rejection of a batch file does not relieve the filer of the responsibility to file within the 
required time  frames established by the BSA regulations. 
An accepted batch file containing primary errors, must be re- filed as corrected reports with 
the primary errors and any secondary errors corrected.  FinCEN reports that contain only secondary errors need not be corrected.  
Naming Conventio ns 
The “Filing Name” fields on the BSA E -Filing Header page are for the bank to use as an 
internal filing in such a manner as to distinguish it from other filings submitted.  As such, 
each file name should be unique.  This will be especially useful when using the Track Status feature in BSA E -Filing.  Naming conventions optimize the bank’s ability to distinguish files 
from one another, but not to disclose sensitive information contained on the BSA reports.  Having a standard naming convention will be even more important if the organization has multiple people responsible for filing.  Each filer will want to distinguish their filings from ones submitted by other filers within the organization.  Conventions may include a filer’s abbreviated name or initials, date of submission, and a sequence number of filings in one day 
--- Page 412 ---
Appendix T: BSA E -Filing System 
FFIEC BSA/AML Examination Manual  T–11 2/27/2015.V2  (to the extent that multiple filings are submitted in one day).  So, for example the third filing 
prepared by John Smith on April 1st, 2014 might be named JoeSmithCTR04012014-3. 
Once a naming convention has been developed, banks should ensure appropriate personnel 
are trained accordingly.  
Work -In-Progress Reports 
The Work- in-Progress (WIP) system collects and stores data from FinCEN’s BSA E -Filing 
System and develops trending information and reports on BSA electronic filing patterns.  
Key functionality of the WIP system includes: 
•Identifying, capturing and storing data on errors found in e-filed BSA documents;
•Providing statistical outputs of trend metrics, such as filing patterns and behavior, data
quality issues, and filing errors; and
•Reporting feedback to BSA filers about their overall E- Filing data quality.
Every month, the Supervisory User will receive two filer feedback reports from the BSA E-
Filing Secure Messenger.  These reports are int ended to show trending errors for a given 
form type and identify systemic problems the filer may be experiencing.  The two reports are 
identified below: 
•Potential Data Quality Issues by Form Type.  This report provides a monthly ranking and
frequency of filing errors by form type;  and
•Filing Statistics by Form Type.  This report provides filing counts by form type over acalendar year.
