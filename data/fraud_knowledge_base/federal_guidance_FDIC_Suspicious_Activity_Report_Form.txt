Suspicious Activity Report
Instructions
 Safe Harbor   Federal law (31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3)) provides complete protection from civil liability for all reports of suspicious
 transactions made to appropriate authorities, including supporting documentation, regardless of whether such reports are filed pursuant to this report’s instructions or are filed on a voluntary basis. Specifically, the law provides that a financia l
 institution, and its directors, officers, employees and agents, that make a disclosure of any possible violation of law or regulation, including in connection with the preparation of suspicious activity reports, “shall not be liable to any person under any law or regulation of the United States, any constitution, law, or regulation of any State or political subdivision o f
 any State, or under any contract or other legally  enforceable agreement (including any arbitration agreement), for such disclosure or for any failure to provide notice of such disclosure to the person who is the subject of such disclosure or any other person identified in the disclosure”. Notification Prohibited Federal law (31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2)) requires that a financial institution, and its directors, officers,
 employees and agents who, voluntarily or by means of a suspicious activity report, report suspected or known criminal
 violations or suspicious activities may not notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been report ed.
 In situations involving violations requiring immediate attention, such as when a reportable violation is ongoing, the
 financial institution shall immediately notify, by telephone, appropriate law enforcement and financial institution
 supervisory authorities in addition to filing a timely suspicious activity report.
WHEN TO MAKE A REPORT:
1. All financial institutions operating in the United States, including insured banks, savings associations, savings
association service corporations, credit unions, bank holding companies, nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding
companies, Edge and Agreement corporations, and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, are re-quired to make this report following the discovery of:
a. Insider abuse involving any amount.  Whenever the financial institution detects any known or suspected
Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the financialinstitution or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the financial institution, where the
financial institution believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of
criminal violations, or that the financial institution was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and thefinancial institution has a substantial basis for identifying one of its directors, officers, employees, agents or
other institution-affiliated parties as having committed or aided in the commission of a criminal act regardless
of the amount involved in the violation.
b. Violations aggregating $5,000 or more where a suspect can be identified.  Whenever the financial
institution detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, com-
mitted or attempted against the financial institution or involving a transaction or transactions conductedthrough the financial institution and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, where
the financial institution believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series
of criminal violations, or that the financial institution was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and thefinancial institution has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. If it is
determined prior to filing this report that the identified suspect or group of suspects has used an “alias,” then
information regarding the true identity of the suspect or group of suspects, as well as alias identifiers, suchas drivers’ licenses or social security numbers, addresses and telephone numbers, must be reported.
c. Violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of a potential suspect. Whenever the financial
institution detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, com-mitted or attempted against the financial institution or involving a transaction or transactions conducted
through the financial institution and involving or aggregating $25,000 or more in funds or other assets, where
the financial institution believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or seriesof criminal violations, or that the financial institution was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, even though
there is no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects.
d. Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or violations of the
Bank Secrecy Act.  Any transaction (which for purposes of this subsection means a deposit, withdrawal,
transfer between accounts, exchange of currency, loan, extension of credit, purchase or sale of any stock,
bond, certificate of deposit, or other monetary instrument or investment security, or any other payment, transfer,or delivery by, through, or to a financial institution, by whatever means effected) conducted or attempted by, at
--- Page 5 ---
or through the financial institution and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the financial
institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that:
          i.  The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities or is intended or conducted in order to hide or
               disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activities (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature,
      source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan to violate or evade any law or regulation or
      to avoid any transaction reporting requirement under Federal law;
ii.  The transaction is designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act; oriii. The transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer
would normally be expected to engage, and the financial institution knows of no reasonable explanation for thetransaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.
      The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to file currency transaction reports (CTRs) in accordance with
   the Department of the Treasury’s implementing regulations (31 CFR Part 103). These regulations require a financial
   institution to file a CTR whenever a currency transaction exceeds $10,000. If a currency transaction exceeds $10,000   and is suspicious, the institution must file both a CTR (reporting the currency transaction) and a suspicious activity
   report (reporting the suspicious or criminal aspects of the transaction). If a currency transaction equals or is below
   $10,000 and is suspicious, the institution should only file a suspicious activity report.
  2. Computer Intrusion.   For purposes of this report, “computer intrusion” is defined as gaining access to a
   computer system of a financial institution to:
a. Remove, steal, procure, or otherwise affect funds of the institution or the institution’s customers;
           b. Remove, steal, procure or otherwise affect critical information of the institution including customer account
         information; or
c. Damage, disable or otherwise affect critical systems of the institution.
   For purposes of this reporting requirement, computer intrusion does not mean attempted intrusions of websites or
   other non-critical information systems of the institution that provide no access to institution or customer financial or
   other critical information.
  3. A financial institution is required to file a suspicious activity report no later than 30 calendar days after the date of
      initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a suspicious activity report. If no suspect was identif ied
   on the date of detection of the incident requiring the filing, a financial institution may delay filing a suspicious activit y
   report for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60   calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction.
  4. This suspicious activity report does not need to be filed for those robberies and burglaries that are reported to local
   authorities, or (except for savings associations and service corporations) for lost, missing, counterfeit, or stolen
   securities that are reported pursuant to the requirements of 17 CFR 240.17f-1.
HOW TO MAKE A REPORT:
  1. Send each completed suspicious activity report to:
Detroit Computing Center, P.O. Box 33980, Detroit, Ml 48232-0980
  2. For items that do not apply or for which information is not available, leave blank.
  3. If you are correcting a previously filed report, check the box at the top of the report (line 1). Complete the report in i ts
  entirety and include the corrected information in the applicable boxes. Then describe the changes that are being made  in Part V (Description of Suspicious Activity), line k.
  4. Do not include any supporting documentation with the suspicious activity report.  Identify and retain a copy
  of the suspi cious activity report and all original supporting documentation or business record equivalent for five (5)
  years from the date of the suspicious activity report. All supporting documentation must be made available to
  appropriate authorities upon request.
  5. If more space is needed to report additional suspects, attach copies of page 1 to provide the add itional information. If
  more space is needed to report additional branch addresses, include this information in the narrative, Part V.
  6. Financial institutions are encouraged to provide copies of suspicious activity reports to state and local authorities,
  where appropriate.
