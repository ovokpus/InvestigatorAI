## Task 1: Defining Problem and Audience

### Problem Statement (1-sentence)

Fraud analysts at financial institutions spend 4-6 hours manually investigating each suspicious transaction while struggling to find similar historical cases and ensure regulatory compliance, creating operational inefficiency and increased fraud risk exposure.

### Why This Is A Problem for Fraud Analysts

**Operational Inefficiency and Risk Exposure**: Fraud analysts at banks, credit unions, and financial service companies face a critical time-cost problem that directly impacts business operations and regulatory compliance. Currently, each suspicious transaction investigation requires 4-6 hours of manual work, during which analysts must: 

- Manually search through historical case databases to find similar fraud patterns
- Cross-reference multiple regulatory databases (FinCEN, OFAC, FFIEC) to ensure compliance requirements are met  
- Compile evidence from disparate systems and data sources
- Document findings according to strict regulatory standards for potential SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) filing

**Business Impact**: With medium-sized financial institutions processing 5,000-10,000 transactions daily and flagging 2-5% as suspicious for investigation, analysts become severely backlogged. This creates two critical problems: (1) **Time-to-Detection Risk** - genuine fraud cases sit in queues for days while analysts work through backlogs, allowing fraudsters additional time to exploit vulnerabilities and transfer funds, and (2) **Regulatory Compliance Risk** - rushed investigations to clear backlogs often miss critical compliance documentation, exposing institutions to regulatory penalties that can exceed $10M annually for AML/BSA violations.

The target users - fraud analysts, AML compliance officers, and investigation supervisors - consistently report that their biggest pain point is not the fraud detection itself (automated systems handle initial flagging), but the thorough investigation and documentation required to make defensible decisions while meeting strict regulatory timelines.

## Task 2: Proposed Solution

### Solution Overview

**InvestigatorAI transforms fraud investigation from a 6-hour manual process into a 90-minute AI-assisted workflow** by deploying a multi-agent system that combines real-time fraud detection with comprehensive investigation orchestration. The solution provides fraud analysts with an intelligent investigation assistant that automatically researches similar historical cases, compiles evidence across multiple data sources, ensures regulatory compliance requirements are met, and generates investigation documentation - all while maintaining the analyst's decision-making authority and meeting strict financial industry security standards.

**User Experience**: Analysts will interact with a unified investigation dashboard where they can input a flagged transaction and receive a comprehensive investigation package within 90 minutes. The system presents evidence in an interactive timeline, highlights similar historical cases with outcomes, provides regulatory compliance checklists, and generates draft investigation reports. This allows analysts to focus their expertise on pattern recognition and decision-making rather than data gathering and documentation compilation.

### Technology Stack with Justification

#### 1. **LLM: OpenAI GPT-4**
*Chosen for superior reasoning capabilities in complex financial investigation scenarios and proven performance in regulatory document analysis.*

#### 2. **Embedding Model: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large** 
*Selected for high-dimensional representation that captures nuanced financial terminology and regulatory language patterns essential for accurate case similarity matching.*

#### 3. **Orchestration: LangGraph**
*Provides sophisticated multi-agent workflow management with state persistence, enabling complex investigation logic with proper error handling and audit trails required in financial environments.*

#### 4. **Vector Database: Qdrant**
*Offers production-grade vector search with metadata filtering capabilities essential for searching regulatory documents and research papers by content type, jurisdiction, and regulatory topic.*

#### 5. **Monitoring: LangSmith**
*Enables comprehensive agent performance tracking and investigation audit trails necessary for regulatory compliance and system optimization.*

#### 6. **Evaluation: RAGAS Framework**
*Provides standardized metrics (faithfulness, relevance, precision, recall) for measuring investigation quality and ensuring consistent performance across case types.*

#### 7. **User Interface: React + TypeScript with Next.js**
*Creates responsive investigation dashboard optimized for complex data visualization and real-time collaboration between multiple analysts.*

#### 8. **Serving & Inference: FastAPI**
*Delivers high-performance API layer with async processing capabilities to handle concurrent investigation workflows while maintaining sub-second response times.*

### Agentic Reasoning Implementation

**Multi-Agent Investigation Workflow**: The system employs five specialized agents coordinated through LangGraph state management:

1. **Regulatory Research Agent** - Uses RAG to find relevant guidance from government regulatory documents and academic research papers
2. **Evidence Collection Agent** - Aggregates transaction data, behavioral patterns, and risk indicators  
3. **Regulatory Compliance Agent** - Ensures AML/BSA/SAR requirements are met with automated compliance checking
4. **Investigation Report Agent** - Generates comprehensive documentation with regulatory citations
5. **Coordination Agent** - Orchestrates workflow, manages agent handoffs, and maintains investigation state

**Agentic reasoning** enables each agent to make autonomous decisions within their domain expertise while sharing context through the central state graph. For example, the Compliance Agent can automatically trigger additional KYC verification if money laundering indicators exceed thresholds, while the Historical Case Agent dynamically adjusts search parameters based on evidence collected by other agents.
