## üß† **Prompting Philosophy & Rationale**

### **Design Philosophy: Professional Role-Based Prompting**

The InvestigatorAI system employs **role-based prompting** as its core methodology, where each agent is assigned a specific professional role with corresponding expertise, responsibilities, and behavioral patterns. This approach is grounded in several key principles:

#### **1. Cognitive Specialization Theory**
**Rationale**: Human experts develop domain-specific cognitive patterns through years of experience. By defining specific professional roles, we leverage the LLM's training on professional communications to simulate expert-level analysis.

**Implementation**: Each agent receives:
- **Precise role definition** (e.g., "Senior Regulatory Research Specialist")
- **Domain expertise boundaries** (e.g., "AML/BSA compliance, international sanctions")
- **Professional context** that activates relevant training patterns

#### **2. Structured Output Methodology**
**Rationale**: Professional investigations require standardized documentation for regulatory compliance, audit trails, and legal proceedings. Structured outputs ensure consistency and completeness.

**Implementation**:
- **Hierarchical report templates** that mirror industry standards
- **Mandatory sections** that ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Professional formatting** suitable for regulatory review

#### **3. Tool-Guided Analysis Framework**
**Rationale**: Human experts follow established procedures and use specific tools for different analysis types. This structured approach prevents oversight and ensures thorough investigation.

**Implementation**:
- **Mandatory tool sequences** for each agent type
- **Cross-validation requirements** across multiple sources
- **Escalation triggers** based on tool outputs

#### **4. Defensive Compliance Positioning**
**Rationale**: In regulatory environments, conservative interpretations protect against violations. Agents are instructed to err on the side of caution when regulatory requirements are ambiguous.

**Implementation**:
- **Conservative thresholds** for risk classifications
- **Mandatory escalation** for borderline cases
- **Explicit regulatory justification** for all determinations
